## Title
Funding: add .github/FUNDING.yml + Sponsorship policy (UTCS wired)

## Summary
- Add `.github/FUNDING.yml` with `github: ['Robbbo-T']` and custom fallback
- Add `FINANCE/SPONSORSHIP.md` (IDEALE-EU, MAL-EEM, anti-speculative)
- Wire funding docs into `utcs/manifest.yaml`
- Add Sponsors badge to README
- CI sanity check for FUNDING.yml

## Canon checks
- [x] Bridge QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB unchanged
- [x] UTCS phrasing intact
- [x] QOx = Quantum Optimizations
- [x] PAx orientation markers: OB/OFF only
- [x] AMPEL360 remains commons (no app code)

## Evidence
- [ ] CI `Funding config check` passes
- [ ] UTCS bundle includes `FINANCE/SPONSORSHIP.md`
