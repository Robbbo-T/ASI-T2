# Physical Environment Context

Context-specific environments within the physical operational domain, covering air, sea, ground, space, and cyber-physical systems.

## Context Categories

- [`AIR/`](./AIR/) — Airborne platforms and atmospheric operations
- [`SEA/`](./SEA/) — Maritime surface and shallow water operations
- [`DEEP_SEA/`](./DEEP_SEA/) — Deep ocean and underwater operations
- [`GROUND/`](./GROUND/) — Terrestrial and land-based operations
- [`SPACE/`](./SPACE/) — Orbital and near-space operations
- [`DEEP_SPACE/`](./DEEP_SPACE/) — Deep space and interplanetary operations
- [`CYBER/`](./CYBER/) — Cyber-physical systems and IoT networks

## Integration Points

Physical context environments integrate with:
- Digital environments for sensor data processing and control
- Cross-domain logistics and supply chains
- Autonomous systems requiring multi-context awareness
- Communication networks spanning multiple physical domains
