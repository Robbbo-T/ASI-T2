1.  **What is the full name of the QAIM model?**
    The full name is Quantum AI Model for Quantum Augmented/Accelerated Industrial Management.

2.  **What is the "heart of QAIM"?**
    The IIS (Integrated Intelligence & Software) domain is the "heart of QAIM."

3.  **What is the ethics guard for QAIM?**
    The ethics guard for QAIM is "MAL-EEM".

4.  **How does QAIM achieve hardware agnosticism?**
    QAIM achieves hardware agnosticism through the Quantum Hardware Abstraction Layer (Q-HAL), which is managed by the CQH domain and provides a single, stable interface to different quantum computers.

5.  **Which CAx domain is responsible for "QUBO compilation (logical to physical qubits)"?**
    The CASE (CQH) domain is responsible for "QUBO compilation (logical to physical qubits)".

6.  **In the self-referential improvement loop, what is the first step?**
    The first step is Model (CAx), where a component of the QAIM platform is modeled as a classical software system.

7.  **What is the "root of trust" for all other ASI-T2 products?**
    The UTCS log for QAIM is the root of trust for all other products.

8.  **What is a "Solver Kernel"?**
    A "Solver Kernel" is the core algorithmic engine within QAIM that executes the quantum or hybrid computation.

9.  **Are there any domains that do not have a QOx process listed?**
    Yes, the DDD and OOO domains do not have a QOx process listed.

10. **Which two other ASI-T2 products are mentioned by name in the document?**
    The two other ASI-T2 products mentioned by name are BWB-Q100 and GAIA-SAT.
