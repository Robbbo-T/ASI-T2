# Digital Environment Context

Context-specific environments within the digital operational domain, covering virtual, quantum, and augmented reality systems.

## Context Categories

- [`VIRTUAL/`](./VIRTUAL/) — Virtual reality and immersive digital environments
- [`QUANTUM/`](./QUANTUM/) — Quantum computing and quantum simulation contexts
- [`AUGMENTATION/`](./AUGMENTATION/) — Augmented reality and mixed reality systems
- [`EXTENSION/`](./EXTENSION/) — Extended reality (XR) and spatial computing
- [`PROJECTION/`](./PROJECTION/) — Holographic and projection-based interfaces
- [`MIX/`](./MIX/) — Mixed reality and hybrid digital-physical environments
- [`CROSS/`](./CROSS/) — Cross-domain and multi-context integration

## Integration Points

Digital context environments integrate with:
- Physical environment contexts for mixed reality applications
- Quantum systems for enhanced computational capabilities  
- AI/ML pipelines for intelligent context adaptation
- Cross-domain applications requiring multi-context support
