# ASI-T2 Finance Model: Sustainable and Anti-Speculative

**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Status**: DRAFT — Conceptual Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This whitepaper presents a **sustainable and anti-speculative financial model** for the ASI-T2 ecosystem. The model prioritizes **service delivery** and **measurable impact** over price speculation, aligning financial incentives with real operational metrics (flight safety, energy efficiency, mission success).

### Core Principles

1. **Service-Objective, Not Price-Objective**: Value tied to capacity/impact, not market speculation
2. **Anti-Speculation Mechanisms**: Demurrage, lock-ups, and bonding curves to discourage trading
3. **Impact-Based Rewards**: Compensation based on verified SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
4. **Full Transparency**: SBOM + UTCS as basis of trust, open treasury
5. **Community Governance**: Quadratic funding for public-interest R&D

## Problem Statement

Traditional crypto/token models suffer from:
- ❌ **Excessive volatility**: Price-driven speculation disconnected from utility
- ❌ **Pump-and-dump schemes**: Short-term profit extraction
- ❌ **Misaligned incentives**: Trading rewards > operational rewards
- ❌ **Lack of real value**: Tokens without underlying service value

### ASI-T2 Requirements

ASI-T2 operates in **safety-critical domains** (aerospace, defense, space):
- ✅ **Stability required**: Volatile funding disrupts long development cycles
- ✅ **Long-term alignment**: 5-10 year product development timelines
- ✅ **Measurable value**: Flight hours, missions, safety records
- ✅ **Regulatory compliance**: Financial systems must be auditable

---

## Model Design

### 1. Service Credits (Non-Transferable)

**Concept**: Internal credits for service consumption, non-transferable outside ecosystem

**Properties**:
- Earned through contributions (development, testing, validation)
- Consumed for services (compute, storage, API access)
- Cannot be traded externally
- Can be delegated within ecosystem

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminates external speculation
- ✅ Ties value to actual service usage
- ✅ Simplifies compliance
- ✅ Encourages participation over trading

### 2. Utility Token with Demurrage

**Concept**: Tradeable token with **demurrage** (holding cost) to discourage speculation

**Mechanism**:
```
Token Value = Base Value × (1 - demurrage_rate × holding_time)
```

**Parameters**:
- Demurrage rate: 0.5-2% per month
- Applies to inactive holdings
- Exempt for: active staking, service consumption

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Discourages long-term hoarding
- ✅ Encourages active participation
- ✅ Creates natural circulation
- ✅ Reduces volatility

### 3. Stabilized Bonding Curve

**Concept**: Price discovery through bonding curve with **slope limits** and **reserves**

**Formula**:
```
Price = Base × (Supply / Target)^exponent
```

**Constraints**:
- Exponent: 0.3-0.5 (flatter curve = less volatility)
- Reserve ratio: 50-80% backing
- Maximum price change: ±10% per day

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Predictable pricing
- ✅ Reduced speculation opportunities
- ✅ Automatic liquidity
- ✅ Capital reserve for operations

### 4. Dynamic Lock-Ups

**Concept**: Variable lock-up periods based on purchase timing and amount

**Rules**:
```
Lock-up Period = Base Period × (1 + Purchase Amount / Threshold)
```

**Parameters**:
- Base period: 30-90 days
- Large purchases: extended lock-up
- Gradual unlock (vesting)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents large dumps
- ✅ Encourages long-term holding
- ✅ Reduces manipulation
- ✅ Stabilizes price

## Impact-Based Incentives

### Proof of Impact

Rewards tied to **verified operational metrics**:

**AMPEL360 BWB**:
- Flight hours (SIL/HIL/real)
- Safety record
- Energy efficiency
- Maintenance quality

**GAIA SPACE**:
- Successful orbits
- Data downlink volume
- Mission success rate
- Constellation availability

**Defense Wall Swarm**:
- Mission success rate
- Coordination efficiency
- Zero-incident operations
- Ethics compliance

### SLO-Based Rewards

```
Reward = Base × SLO Achievement × Impact Multiplier
```

**SLO Thresholds**:
- 100% achievement: Base reward
- >100% achievement: Bonus multiplier
- <100% achievement: Reduced/no reward

**Impact Multiplier**:
- Public safety benefit: 2x
- Open-source contribution: 1.5x
- Community validation: 1.3x

---

## Slashing for Non-Compliance

### Slashing Conditions

Penalties for:
- ❌ Missing critical SLOs
- ❌ Safety violations
- ❌ Ethics breaches (MAL-EEM)
- ❌ False attestations

### Slashing Amounts

```
Slash Amount = Stake × Severity × Impact
```

**Severity Levels**:
- Minor: 5-10% slash
- Moderate: 10-25% slash
- Major: 25-50% slash
- Critical: 50-100% slash

**Slash Distribution**:
- 50% burned (permanent removal)
- 30% to treasury
- 20% to affected parties

---

## Transparency & Governance

### On-Chain Evidence

All financial operations linked to:
- **SBOM**: Software provenance
- **UTCS**: Immutable anchors
- **Test Results**: Verified outcomes
- **Mission Logs**: Operational data

### Treasury Management

**Multisig Treasury**:
- 3-of-5 multisig
- MAL-EEM policy enforcement
- Quarterly reporting
- Public audit trail

**Allocation**:
- 40% Operations (infrastructure, dev)
- 30% R&D (innovation, experiments)
- 20% Reserves (stability, emergencies)
- 10% Community (grants, bounties)

### Quadratic Funding

**Public Goods Funding**:
- Community proposes projects
- Quadratic funding for matching
- Focus: safety, sustainability, open-source
- Quarterly rounds

**Formula**:
```
Match Amount = (Sum of sqrt(contribution))^2
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Democratic allocation
- ✅ Favors broad support over large donors
- ✅ Encourages community engagement

## Regulatory Compliance

### KYC/AML

For larger transactions (>$10k):
- Identity verification
- Source of funds
- Transaction monitoring

### Securities Compliance

Design to **avoid security classification**:
- Utility focus (not investment)
- No profit promises
- Service consumption primary use
- Decentralized governance

### Reporting

**Quarterly Reports**:
- Treasury balance
- Token metrics
- SLO achievement
- Community spending

Tools to reduce price volatility:
- Demurrage on idle holdings
- Bonding curve limits
- Dynamic lock-ups
- Reserve stabilization

### Liquidity Management

### Smart Contract Security

Security measures:
- Multi-layer audits
- Formal verification
- Bug bounties
- Upgrade governance
