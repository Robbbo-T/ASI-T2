# ASI-T2 Sustainable Finance Framework

**Status:** Draft for technical review  
**Whitepaper Reference:** [Master Whitepaper #1, Section 4.7](../WHITEPAPERS/MASTER_WHITEPAPER_1.md#47-sustainable-anti-speculative-finance)

---

## Overview

The ASI-T2 Sustainable Finance framework is designed to align economic incentives with service delivery, ethical governance, and verifiable impact. It stands in contrast to speculative finance models by emphasizing **service-objective outcomes (SLOs)**, **operational credits**, and **quadratic funding** for public-interest R&D.

This framework is not financial advice but a technical architecture for value exchange and resource allocation within the ASI-T2 ecosystem.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Service-Aligned Economics

* **Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** Financial rewards tied to measurable service delivery.
* **Performance-Based Allocation:** Resources flow to systems and teams meeting or exceeding SLOs.
* **Verifiable Impact:** All claims must be backed by UTCS-anchored evidence.

### 2. Anti-Speculation Mechanisms

* **Demurrage:** Holding costs applied to idle balances to discourage hoarding and encourage circulation.
* **Lock-ups:** Time-locked commitments for long-term stability.
* **Reserve Requirements:** Mandatory reserves to ensure system solvency.

### 3. Operational Credits (Non-Transferable)

* **Definition:** Tokens bound to specific service usage within the ecosystem.
* **Characteristics:**
  - Cannot be traded on secondary markets
  - Expire after a defined period
  - Tied to specific products/services (AMPEL360 flights, GAIA data access, etc.)
* **Purpose:** Prevent speculation while enabling service consumption.

### 4. Quadratic Funding for Public Goods

* **Mechanism:** Matching funds favor projects with broad-based community support.
* **Target:** Public-interest R&D, safety improvements, open-source contributions.
* **Governance:** Transparent allocation via multisig treasury and MAL-EEM policies.

### 5. Slashing for SLO Breaches

* **Trigger:** Failure to meet committed SLOs or violation of MAL-EEM policies.
* **Mechanism:** Automated reduction of allocated resources.
* **Appeals:** Dispute resolution process with evidence review.

## Financial Architecture

### Treasury Structure

```
ASI-T2 Treasury
├── Operational Reserve (40%)
│   └── Emergency fund for critical operations
├── Service Delivery Pool (30%)
│   └── Rewards for SLO achievement
├── Public R&D Fund (20%)
│   └── Quadratic funding pool
└── Governance Reserve (10%)
    └── Protocol upgrades and audits
```

### Value Flow

```
Service Delivery → Evidence Generation → SLO Verification → Reward Distribution
                ↓
        UTCS Anchoring → Audit Trail → Compliance Check
```

---

## Governance

### Multisig Treasury

* **Signatories:** Minimum 3 of 5 required for transactions.
* **Transparency:** All transactions logged and published.
* **Audit:** Quarterly reviews by independent auditors.

### MAL-EEM Integration

* **Policy Enforcement:** All financial decisions pass through MAL-EEM checks.
* **Kill-Switch:** Emergency halt for detected violations.
* **Decision Logging:** Immutable record of all governance actions.

---

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **% Funds to Service Delivery:** Target >70%
* **% Funds to Public R&D:** Target >15%
* **Volatility Threshold:** <20% monthly variance
* **SLO Compliance Rate:** Target >95%
* **Treasury Reserve Ratio:** Target >30%

### Reporting

* **Frequency:** Monthly summary, quarterly detailed report
* **Format:** Machine-readable JSON + human-readable markdown
* **Publication:** Public repository with UTCS anchoring

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Volatility:** Mitigated by reserves and operational credits
2. **Gaming:** Prevented by UTCS evidence requirements and MAL-EEM checks
3. **Regulatory:** Early engagement with legal counsel and compliance reviews
4. **Technical:** Fail-safe mechanisms and circuit breakers

### Mitigation Strategies

* **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards and alerts
* **Circuit Breakers:** Automatic suspension on anomalies
* **Insurance Fund:** Coverage for unexpected losses
* **Legal Framework:** Ongoing compliance verification
