# Sponsorship & Funding Policy (IDEALE-EU · MAL-EEM)

**Purpose.** Funding sustains verifiable R&D aligned with **IDEALE-EU** (Intelligence, Defense, Energy, Aerospace, Logistics — ESG-EU) and guided by **MAL-EEM** ethics (non-weaponisation, decision logging, revocation).

**Canon.**
- Bridge: **QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB**
- **UTCS = UiX Threading Context/Content/Cache & Structure/Style/Sheet**
- **QOx = Quantum Optimizations**
- **PAx orientation markers = OB/OFF only**

**Principles.**
1. **Evidence-aligned.** Releases ship SBOMs, hashes, tags, UTCS bundles, and (when available) DOIs.
2. **Anti-speculative.** No token trading; focus on service SLOs and public-interest R&D.
3. **Transparency.** Disclose goals, milestones, and impact metrics (climate/energy/safety).
4. **Compliance.** Respect export controls (EU 2021/821; ITAR/EAR) and MAL-EEM.

**How to sponsor.**
