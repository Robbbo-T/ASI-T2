# Low-Level Requirements (LLR)

This directory contains detailed low-level requirements organized by functional modules:

- `mode_manager_llr.md` — Requirements for mode management logic
- `lateral_control_llr.md` — Requirements for lateral autopilot functions
- `vertical_control_llr.md` — Requirements for vertical autopilot functions
- `safety_monitors_llr.md` — Requirements for safety monitoring functions
- `interfaces_llr.md` — Requirements for external interfaces

Each LLR document provides:
- Detailed functional requirements derived from HLR
- Performance requirements (timing, accuracy, range)
- Interface requirements (data formats, protocols)
- Safety requirements (failure modes, monitoring)
- Traceability to parent HLR requirements
