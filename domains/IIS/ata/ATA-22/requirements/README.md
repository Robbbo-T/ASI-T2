This directory contains the requirements hierarchy for ATA-22 Autoflight system.

## Contents

- `HLR.md` — High-Level Requirements (system level)
- `LLR/` — Low-Level Requirements (detailed functional requirements)

## Requirements Structure

### High-Level Requirements (HLR)
System-level requirements defining:
- Autopilot engage/disengage functionality
- Lateral and vertical mode management
- Flight Director operation
- Safety monitoring and interlocks
- Interface compliance with other ATA systems

### Low-Level Requirements (LLR)
Detailed functional requirements organized by:
- Mode management logic

## Traceability

Requirements are structured to support DO-178C certification:
- HLR → LLR traceability maintained
- Each requirement linked to verification methods
- Coverage analysis for test completeness
- Impact assessment for requirement changes

## Verification Methods

- **Analysis**: Mathematical proof of correctness
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and system tests
- **Review**: Design and code inspections
- **Demonstration**: Operational scenarios
