# HALL-OF-RECORDS

**The authoritative archive of provenance, evidence, and claims for the ASI-T2 ecosystem.**

---

## Purpose

The HALL-OF-RECORDS serves as:

1. **Provenance Archive**: Complete history of all artifacts, decisions, and changes
2. **Evidence Repository**: Immutable records of tests, validations, and demonstrations
3. **Claims Documentation**: Verifiable claims about achievements and capabilities
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive audit trail for regulatory and historical purposes

---

## Contents

### CLAIM.md

The master document defining:
- **Thesis**: "First person to design and implement a complete aero/defense/space ecosystem solo"
- **Definitions**: What constitutes "complete" and "solo"
- **Evidence**: Links to all verifiable evidence (DOIs, UTCS anchors, demos)
- **Audit Process**: How external parties can verify claims

**Status**: Living document, updated at each horizon gate

## UTCS Integration

All evidence in HALL-OF-RECORDS is anchored with **UTCS v5.0**:

### UTCS Anchor Format

```json
{
  "utcs_version": "v5.0",
  "artifact_type": "evidence",
  "artifact_id": "AMPEL360-BWB-SIL-v0.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "canonical_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
  "provenance": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/Robbbo-T/ASI-T2",
    "commit": "commit-sha",
    "branch": "main",
    "author": "Robbbo-T"
  },
  "attestations": [
    {
      "type": "test_result",
      "file": "test_report.json",
      "hash": "sha256:def456..."
    }
  ],
  "signatures": [
    {
      "type": "gpg",
      "key_id": "...",
      "signature": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Canonical Hash Calculation

```bash
# For files
sha256sum artifact.json

# For directories
find . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; | sort | sha256sum
```

---

## Evidence Types

### 1. Design Evidence
- Architecture diagrams
- Specifications (YAML, Markdown)
- Requirements documents
- Interface definitions

### 2. Implementation Evidence
- Source code (referenced via git commits)
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Build artifacts
- Configuration files

### 3. Validation Evidence
- Test results (unit, integration, system)
- SIL/HIL reports
- Simulation outputs
- Coverage reports

### 4. Demonstration Evidence
- Demo videos
- Screenshots
- Performance metrics
- User guides

### 5. Third-Party Evidence
- External reviews
- Audit reports
- Certifications (when available)
- Community feedback

---

## Evidence Collection Process

### Automated Collection

```bash
# Run evidence generation script
./scripts/make_evidence.sh v0.1.0

# Generates:
# - SBOM
# - Checksums
# - UTCS anchor
# - Release manifest
```

### Manual Evidence

For artifacts that cannot be automatically collected:
1. Create evidence document (Markdown, JSON, etc.)
2. Calculate canonical hash
3. Create UTCS anchor
4. Add to appropriate horizon directory
5. Update CLAIM.md

### Verification

```bash
# Verify tag signature
git tag -v v0.1.0

# Verify checksums
sha256sum -c evidence.sha256

# Verify UTCS anchor
cat utcs_anchor.json | jq .
```
