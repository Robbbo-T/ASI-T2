# GENESIS (canon)
This document references the GENESIS canon and its role as the SSoT for context.  
- Canon link: [UTCS_BUNDLE/manifest.utcs.yaml](../UTCS_BUNDLE/manifest.utcs.yaml)

## Overview
The GENESIS canon establishes the foundational context for ASI-T2 project, including:
- Unified architecture principles
- TFA V2 alignment
- UTCS (UiX Threading Context/Content/Cache and Structure/Style/Sheet)
- Bridge: QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB
- Domain structure and PAx flows

## Source of Truth
The canonical GENESIS document serves as the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for:
- Architecture decisions
- Domain definitions
- Interface contracts
- Traceability flows
- Evidence requirements
