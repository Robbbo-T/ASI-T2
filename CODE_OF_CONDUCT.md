## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (TSC chairs, working group leads, Council members) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub repos, mailing lists, discussion forums, conferences, meetings) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (e.g., speaking at a conference, posting on social media as a federation representative).

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### 5. Legal/Regulatory Escalation

**Community Impact:** Violations involving safety, security, export control, or legal compliance that pose risk to the federation, its members, or the public.

**Consequence:** Immediate suspension of access, notification to relevant authorities (FAA, EASA, law enforcement, etc.), and potential legal action. This path is reserved for severe violations such as:
- Falsifying certification evidence
- Deliberately introducing security vulnerabilities
- Violating export control regulations
- Data breaches involving personal information

---

## Appeals

Any individual subject to enforcement action may appeal by sending an email to appeals@ideale-eu.example within 14 days of the decision. The appeal will be reviewed by the IDEALE Council (excluding any members involved in the original decision). The Council's decision is final.

Appeals should include:
- Description of the original incident and enforcement action
- Reasons why the action should be reconsidered
- Any new information or context not previously available

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

Federation-specific provisions (safety, security, export control, privacy) were developed in consultation with aerospace industry best practices, FAA/EASA guidelines, NIS2 directive, and GDPR requirements.
