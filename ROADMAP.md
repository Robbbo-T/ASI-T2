## Vision 2028

By 2028, IDEALE-EU becomes the reference implementation for transatlantic aerospace technical commons, demonstrating:

✅ **FAA↔EASA mutual recognition** of digital certification artifacts  
✅ **Quantum-accelerated design cycles** reducing time-to-market by 20%  
✅ **Zero-knowledge supply chain** with full SBOM coverage and provenance  
✅ **Sustainable aircraft prototypes** meeting emissions reduction targets

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. **Certification Bridge** (FAA↔EASA)
Align digital artifacts with bilateral safety framework for mutual acceptance of:
- Type certificates (TC)
- Supplemental type certificates (STC)
- Production approvals (PC)
- Continued airworthiness (AD)

### 2. **Quantum Integration** (QAIM)
Deploy quantum-classical hybrid workflows for:
- Topology optimization (reduce weight 10-15%)
- Supply chain logistics (route optimization)
- Cryptography (post-quantum key exchange)

### 3. **Sustainability Metrics**
Demonstrate measurable improvements:
- Fuel efficiency: +5-15%
- Emissions: −10-20% CO₂, −30% NOₓ
- Noise: −50% perceived loudness (dB)
- Circularity: 80% recyclable by mass

### 4. **Security & Trust**
Establish baseline for supply chain assurance:
- SLSA Level 3+ for all releases
- SBOM coverage: 100% of delivered software/firmware
- Incident response: <24h public disclosure (coordinated)

## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Dependencies
- **Regulatory approval**: FAA/EASA timelines unpredictable (mitigation: early engagement, iterative submissions)
- **Quantum hardware access**: QPU availability limited (mitigation: simulator fallback, hybrid classical-quantum)
- **Funding**: R&D costs substantial (mitigation: public grants, industry partnerships)

### Technical Risks
- **Standards convergence**: FAA/EASA processes differ (mitigation: digital artifact harmonization, bilateral working groups)
- **Cybersecurity**: NIS2 compliance complex (mitigation: security-by-design, third-party audits)
- **Export control**: CONTROLLED artifacts hard to manage (mitigation: off-repo pointers, policy-as-code)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Iterative development**: Frequent releases, continuous feedback
- **Community engagement**: Transparent communication, open RFCs
- **Partnerships**: Leverage existing frameworks (EASA Innovation Hub, FAA UAS IPP)
