# Sustainable Finance Principles

**Reference:** [Master Whitepaper #1, Section 4.7](../WHITEPAPERS/MASTER_WHITEPAPER_1.md#47-sustainable-anti-speculative-finance)

---

## Core Philosophy

The ASI-T2 financial model is built on the principle that **value should flow to service delivery and verifiable impact**, not speculation. This document details the economic mechanisms that implement this philosophy.

---

## 1. Service-Objective Economics (SLOs)

### Definition

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are quantifiable, verifiable targets for system performance and service delivery. Financial rewards are directly tied to SLO achievement.

### Examples

* **AMPEL360 BWB:** 
  - Energy efficiency: <X MJ per passenger-km
  - Safety: Zero critical failures in Y flight hours
  - Availability: >99.5% operational readiness

* **GAIA SPACE:**
  - Data quality: <0.1% packet loss
  - Latency: <2s downlink delay (95th percentile)
  - Coverage: >95% earth surface visibility per day

* **GAIA AIR Swarm:**
  - Mission success: >98% completion rate
  - Safety: Zero collision incidents
  - Response time: <30s for emergency deployment

### Verification

All SLO claims must be backed by:
1. **UTCS-anchored telemetry** with timestamps
2. **Signed logs** from independent observers
3. **Reproducible evidence** (videos, datasets, analysis)
4. **Third-party validation** at FCR-2 gates

---

## 2. Demurrage (Holding Costs)

### Mechanism

A small percentage fee (e.g., 0.5-2% monthly) applied to idle balances to:
- Discourage hoarding and speculation
- Encourage circulation and productive use
- Align with operational timescales

### Implementation

```
balance_after = balance_before * (1 - demurrage_rate * time_elapsed)
```

### Exemptions

* **Active Service Credits:** Balances actively used within 30 days
* **Locked Commitments:** Time-locked funds for specific projects
* **Reserve Requirements:** Mandatory reserves for system stability

### Economic Rationale

Demurrage inverts the time-preference of money. Instead of "money today is worth more than money tomorrow," it becomes "money in circulation is worth more than idle money."

---

## 3. Lock-Ups & Commitment Mechanisms

### Purpose

Encourage long-term thinking and reduce volatility.

### Types

* **Project Lock-Ups:** Funds committed to specific deliverables
  - Duration: 3-24 months
  - Release: Upon milestone achievement
  - Penalties: Partial forfeit for early withdrawal

* **Governance Lock-Ups:** Voting weight tied to commitment duration
  - Duration: 1-48 months
  - Weight: Quadratic with time (√months)
  - Reward: Additional governance tokens

* **Reserve Lock-Ups:** Mandatory reserves for critical systems
  - Duration: Indefinite
  - Purpose: Systemic stability
  - Oversight: Multisig treasury

---

## 4. Reserve Requirements

### Structure

Different pools require different reserve ratios:

| Pool Type | Reserve Ratio | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Operational | 40% | Emergency operations |
| Service Delivery | 20% | SLO reward buffer |
| Public R&D | 15% | Innovation stability |
| Governance | 30% | Protocol upgrades |

### Dynamic Adjustment

Reserve requirements can be adjusted based on:
- System stress indicators
- Regulatory requirements
- Community governance votes

---

## 5. Operational Credits (Non-Transferable)

### Definition

Service-specific tokens that:
- **Cannot** be traded on secondary markets
- **Cannot** be converted to other currencies
- **Can** be used only for designated services
- **Expire** after a defined period (e.g., 12 months)

### Issuance

Credits are issued in proportion to:
1. Service contribution (e.g., compute provided)
2. SLO achievement
3. Public goods contribution
4. Community governance participation

### Categories

* **Flight Credits:** AMPEL360 flight time
* **Data Credits:** GAIA satellite data access
* **Compute Credits:** QAIM optimization runs
* **Infrastructure Credits:** LH₂ airport services

### Rationale

Operational credits prevent speculation while enabling service consumption. They ensure that rewards benefit actual users rather than financial traders.

---

## 6. Quadratic Funding for Public R&D

### Mechanism

Matching funds are distributed according to the formula:

```
match = (Σ√contribution_i)²
```

Where each individual contribution is square-rooted before summing, then the sum is squared.

### Effect

Projects with broad support (many small contributions) receive disproportionately more matching funds than projects with narrow support (few large contributions).

### Example

**Project A:** 100 contributors × $10 each = $1,000 raised
- Matching calculation: (100 × √10)² = (100 × 3.16)² ≈ $100,000

**Project B:** 1 contributor × $1,000 = $1,000 raised  
- Matching calculation: (1 × √1000)² = (31.6)² ≈ $1,000

Despite equal raw funding, Project A receives ~100x more matching funds due to broader support.

### Governance

* **Pool Size:** 20% of treasury
* **Rounds:** Quarterly
* **Eligibility:** Open-source, public-benefit projects
* **Restrictions:** MAL-EEM compliance required

---

## 7. Slashing for SLO Breaches

### Trigger Conditions

Slashing occurs when:
1. **SLO Failure:** Committed service levels not met
2. **Safety Violation:** MAL-EEM policy breach
3. **Evidence Fraud:** Falsified UTCS anchors
4. **Governance Violation:** Multisig protocol breach

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Slash % | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Minor | 5-10% | Single SLO miss, quickly corrected |
| Moderate | 10-30% | Repeated SLO failures, safety concerns |
| Major | 30-70% | Critical safety breach, fraud evidence |
| Critical | 70-100% | Intentional harm, major fraud |

### Process

1. **Detection:** Automated monitoring or community report
2. **Investigation:** Evidence review (24-72 hours)
3. **Proposal:** Slashing proposal with evidence
4. **Vote:** Multisig approval (3 of 5 required)
5. **Execution:** Automated smart contract enforcement
6. **Appeal:** 30-day window for dispute resolution

### Redistribution

Slashed funds are redistributed to:
- 50% to affected users/services
- 30% to insurance fund
- 20% to public R&D pool

---

## 8. Treasury Governance

### Multisig Structure

* **Signers:** 5 independent parties
* **Threshold:** 3 of 5 required for transactions
* **Term:** 12 months, staggered rotation
* **Selection:** Community nomination + voting

### Decision Types

| Decision Type | Approval Required | Examples |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Routine | 3 of 5 | Monthly SLO rewards |
| Significant | 4 of 5 | Reserve ratio changes |
| Critical | 5 of 5 | Protocol upgrades, emergency halt |

### Transparency

All governance actions are:
1. **Proposed:** Public proposal with rationale
2. **Discussed:** Minimum 7-day comment period
3. **Voted:** On-chain multisig execution
4. **Logged:** Immutable UTCS-anchored record
5. **Reported:** Monthly governance summary

---

## 9. Risk Management

### Circuit Breakers

Automatic suspension triggers:
* **Volatility:** >30% change in 24 hours
* **Volume:** 10x average transaction volume
* **Anomaly:** Pattern detection alerts
* **Security:** Potential exploit detected

### Insurance Fund

* **Size:** 10% of treasury
* **Purpose:** Cover unexpected losses
* **Replenishment:** 2% of all transaction fees
* **Claims:** Multisig approval required

### External Validation

* **Quarterly Audits:** Independent financial review
* **Annual Assessment:** Regulatory compliance check
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards
* **Penetration Testing:** Security assessments

---

## 10. Compliance & Legal Framework

### Regulatory Considerations

* **Securities Law:** Operational credits designed to avoid security classification
* **AML/KYC:** Identity verification for large transactions
* **Tax Reporting:** Automated reporting for jurisdictions
* **Export Control:** Integration with dual-use assessments

### Legal Structure

* **Jurisdiction:** TBD based on operational requirements
* **Entity Type:** Non-profit foundation or benefit corporation
* **Governance:** Board aligned with multisig signers
* **Liability:** Limited liability for participants

---

## 11. Evolution & Adaptation

### Upgrade Process

1. **Proposal:** Community member submits improvement
2. **Review:** Technical and economic analysis
3. **Simulation:** Model impact on treasury and participants
4. **Vote:** Governance approval
5. **Implementation:** Phased rollout with monitoring
6. **Evaluation:** Post-implementation review

### Learning Mechanisms

* **Data Collection:** All transactions logged
* **Analysis:** Monthly economic reports
* **Feedback:** Community surveys and forums
* **Adjustment:** Quarterly parameter tuning

---

## Summary

The ASI-T2 Sustainable Finance framework implements:

✅ Service-aligned rewards (SLOs)  
✅ Anti-speculation (demurrage, operational credits)  
✅ Long-term stability (reserves, lock-ups)  
✅ Public goods funding (quadratic matching)  
✅ Accountability (slashing, transparency)  
✅ Ethical governance (MAL-EEM, multisig)

This creates an economic system that **rewards service delivery and verifiable impact** while **discouraging speculation and extraction**.
