## Overview

ASI-T2 implements a **multi-domain compliance framework** covering aerospace, defense, space systems, and ethical AI:

- ✅ **Aerospace Standards**: ARP4754A, ARP4761, DO-178C, DO-254, S1000D
- ✅ **Space Systems**: ECSS standards, NASA standards
- ✅ **Defense Systems**: MIL-STD, DO-326A/356A (cybersecurity)
- ✅ **Quality Management**: ISO 9001, AS9100
- ✅ **Ethics & AI**: MAL-EEM framework, transparency requirements
- ✅ **Traceability**: UTCS v5.0 for complete provenance

## TFA Compliance Bridge

All products follow the **TFA (Top Federation Algorithm)** pattern for traceability:

```
CB (Conceptual Boundary)
  → Design artifacts, requirements
  
QB (Quantum Boundary)  
  → Quantum-assisted validation, advisories
  
UE (Unit Execution)
  → Component-level execution, unit tests
  
FE (Final Execution)
  → System integration, integration tests
  
FWD (Forward Deployment)
  → Deployment artifacts, configurations
  
QS (Quantum Seal)
  → UTCS anchors, evidence, provenance
```

Each gate requires:
- ✅ Documentation review
- ✅ Test execution
- ✅ Evidence generation
- ✅ Sign-off (automated or manual)

---

## UTCS (Universal Traceability & Configuration System)

### Provenance Requirements

All artifacts must be traceable via UTCS v5.0:

1. **Canonical Hash**: SHA-256 of artifact content
2. **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
3. **Provenance Chain**: Complete dependency graph
4. **Signatures**: GPG/SSH signatures for authenticity
5. **SBOM**: Complete Software Bill of Materials

### Evidence Requirements

Each release requires:

```bash
evidence/
├── sbom.spdx.json           # SPDX 2.3 format
├── sbom.spdx.sha256         # Checksum
├── utcs_anchor.json         # UTCS v5.0 anchor
└── RELEASE_MANIFEST.md      # Human-readable manifest
```

---

## MAL-EEM (Ethics & Empathy Module)

### Ethical Guardrails

All autonomous/AI systems must implement:

1. **Fail-Closed**: System fails to safe state by default
2. **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human approval
3. **Transparency**: Decision rationale must be explainable
4. **Mission Rules**: Clear constraints and boundaries
5. **Emergency Override**: Human can always override system

### Ethics Assessment

Each product with autonomous capabilities requires:

- [ ] Ethics impact assessment
- [ ] Mission rules documentation
- [ ] Human oversight procedures
- [ ] Override mechanisms
- [ ] Incident response plan

---

## Compliance Verification

### Automated Checks

CI/CD pipeline includes:

```bash
# Structure validation
python scripts/verify_structure.py

# Schema validation
python scripts/validate_json.py

# Link checking
python scripts/link_check.py

# Evidence generation
./scripts/make_evidence.sh
```

### Manual Reviews

- [ ] Architecture review
- [ ] Safety review
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Ethics review
- [ ] Documentation review

## Deviations and Waivers

### Solo Development Adaptations

As a **solo-founder project**, certain adaptations are made:

1. **"Lite" Standards**: Core principles maintained, reduced documentation burden
2. **Automated Reviews**: Where possible, replace manual reviews with automation
3. **Progressive Compliance**: Build compliance incrementally across horizons
4. **Open-Source Tools**: Leverage existing validated tools and libraries
5. **Community Review**: Utilize open-source review processes

### Documented Deviations

All deviations from standards are:
- ✅ Documented with rationale
- ✅ Assessed for risk
- ✅ Tracked for resolution
- ✅ Reviewed at gate milestones

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Tracked

- Test coverage (target: >70% by H1)
- Documentation completeness (target: 100%)
- Evidence generation rate (target: 100% automated)
- Standards compliance score (custom rubric)
- Community feedback integration

### Review Cadence

- **Weekly**: Automated checks in CI/CD
- **Monthly**: Manual review of compliance status
- **Per Horizon Gate**: Comprehensive compliance review
- **Annual**: Strategic compliance framework update

---

## External Validation

### Planned External Reviews

- H1 Gate: 2 independent technical reviews
- H2 Gate: Third-party audit
- Ongoing: Community peer review

### Validation Evidence

All external validation results stored in:
- `evidence/external_reviews/`
- Linked in product specs
- Tracked in UTCS anchors
