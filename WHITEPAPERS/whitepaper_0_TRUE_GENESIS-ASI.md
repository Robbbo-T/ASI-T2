# Whitepaper 0 — TRUE_GENESIS-ASI

## Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI) — Aerospace Supernational Intelligence

**Executive Summary**

This whitepaper introduces **ASI (Aerospace Supernational Intelligence)**, a federated, policy-as-code intelligence layer designed for joint EU–US governance in aerospace. ASI orchestrates domain-specific AI agents (design, certification, operations, sustainability) within hard authority boundaries, generating evidence-backed, citable recommendations that map to FAA/EASA regulatory contexts. The system is engineered to be **powerful where allowed, incapable where prohibited**—with no live control, no uncertified modifications, and strict export/privacy enforcement.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Challenge

Modern aerospace development faces unprecedented complexity: multi-domain engineering (structures, systems, certification), stringent safety requirements (DO-178C, DO-254), evolving regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, EASA AI guidance), and the need for international collaboration across different legal jurisdictions.

Traditional approaches struggle with:
- **Fragmented knowledge**: domain expertise scattered across organizations and systems
- **Manual certification**: labor-intensive evidence generation and traceability
- **Regulatory divergence**: differing EU/US requirements and acceptance criteria
- **AI governance gaps**: emerging AI/ML systems lack established assurance patterns

### 1.2 The ASI Solution

**ASI (Aerospace Supernational Intelligence)** is a federated intelligence layer that:
- **Orchestrates domain experts**: coordinates specialized AI agents while maintaining hard boundaries
- **Ensures lawful-by-design operation**: embeds EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and aviation standards
- **Generates citable evidence**: produces FAA/EASA-ready recommendations with full traceability
- **Operates under joint governance**: EU–US oversight with transparent decision-making

ASI is **not** a monolithic super-AI but an **Orchestrator-of-Experts** pattern that:
- Routes queries to appropriate domain agents
- Enforces policy boundaries via executable code (OPA/Rego)
- Assembles multi-domain evidence packages
- Maintains human-in-the-loop for consequential decisions

---

## 3. Core Architecture

### 3.1 Three-Plane Design

ASI operates across three architectural planes, each with distinct responsibilities and interfaces:

#### 3.1.1 Data Plane

**Purpose:** Curated, traceable knowledge foundation

**Components:**
- **AMPEL360**: Commercial aviation datasets (BWB certification, evacuation modeling)
- **GAIA**: Space and satellite constellation data
- **INFRANET**: Infrastructure and operational knowledge
- **Media Provenance**: C2PA-sealed content with cryptographic attribution
- **Software Provenance**: SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs for all components

**Assurance:**
- All datasets labeled with source, quality metrics, usage rights
- Cryptographic sealing (C2PA) for media and derived artifacts
- Version control and rollback capability
- Export control tagging and access logging

#### 3.1.2 Control Plane

**Purpose:** Policy-as-code enforcement and routing

**Components:**
- **Policy Gatekeeper**: OPA/Rego policy evaluation for all requests
- **Authority Router**: directs queries to authorized domain agents
- **Export Control**: screens content against ITAR/EAR regulations
- **Privacy Filter**: enforces GDPR/data residency requirements
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: escalation paths for consequential decisions

**Key Policies (see `ASI_Policy.rego`):**
- No live control authority over aircraft/vehicles/ATC
- No modification of certified software/parameters
- No bypass of certification processes
- Export-controlled content restricted to authorized systems
- Consequential actions require human approval + audit log

#### 3.1.3 Assurance Plane

**Purpose:** Continuous safety, robustness, and alignment evaluation

**Components:**
- **Safety Monitors**: runtime checks for unsafe recommendations
- **Robustness Evaluation**: adversarial testing and red-teaming
- **Alignment Verification**: consistency with stated principles and constraints
- **Supply Chain Attestation**: SLSA framework for build integrity
- **GSN Safety Case**: continuously updated Goal Structuring Notation argument

**Evaluation Cadence:**
- Real-time: per-request policy checks and safety monitors
- Daily: automated robustness regression suite
- Weekly: red-team adversarial evaluations
- Quarterly: external audit and benchmarking
- Major releases: full GSN safety case compilation

### 3.2 Orchestrator-of-Experts Pattern

ASI coordinates specialized domain agents rather than attempting omniscient reasoning:

**Domain Agents:**
1. **Design Agent**: CAD/CAE optimization, trade studies, design space exploration
2. **Certification Agent**: requirements mapping, evidence gap analysis, DO-178C/DO-254 compliance
3. **Operations Agent**: flight planning, maintenance optimization, operational efficiency
4. **Sustainability Agent**: lifecycle assessment, emissions modeling, circular economy

**Coordination Logic:**
1. User query arrives at Control Plane
2. Policy evaluation: export control, privacy, authority boundaries
3. Query routing: decompose into domain-specific sub-queries
4. Parallel expert invocation: each agent operates within its authority
5. Evidence assembly: collect recommendations with source attribution
6. Safety check: verify combined output against hard boundaries
7. Human escalation: flag consequential decisions for approval
8. Delivery: package evidence-backed recommendation to user

**Benefits:**
- **Modularity**: swap domain agents without system redesign
- **Auditability**: trace reasoning through explicit expert chain
- **Boundaries**: each agent has defined scope and authority limits
- **Evidence**: domain experts cite their sources and methods

## 5. Authority Boundaries

See **ASI_Autonomy_Boundaries.md** for complete specification. Key boundaries:

### 5.1 Hard "No-Go" Actions

ASI **cannot** and **will not**:
1. **Command or control** aircraft, vehicles, or air traffic control systems
2. **Modify** type-certified onboard software or parameters
3. **Bypass** established certification processes or regulatory approvals
4. **Access** export-controlled content on public/shared systems (pointers only, with authorization)
5. **Make consequential decisions** without affirmative human approval and full audit logging

### 5.2 Advisory-Only Scope

ASI operates in **advisory mode**:
- Generates recommendations with evidence and confidence levels
- Highlights risks, uncertainties, and knowledge gaps
- Defers to human experts for final decision-making
- Escalates when boundary conditions are approached

### 5.3 Enforcement Mechanisms

**Policy-as-Code (OPA/Rego):**
- Pre-request evaluation: queries blocked if violating boundaries
- Post-generation filtering: unsafe outputs suppressed
- Runtime monitoring: continuous checks during execution
- Audit trail: all policy decisions logged

**Safety Monitors:**
- Hard constraints on output types (no control commands)
- Confidence thresholds: low-confidence outputs flagged
- Consistency checks: detect contradictory recommendations
- Human escalation: automatic trigger for boundary violations

## 7. Evidence-Weave System

### 7.1 Concept

Every ASI recommendation includes a structured **evidence package**:

```yaml
recommendation_id: "ASI-REC-2025-10-03-001"
query: "Optimal evacuation configuration for BWB-Q100"
timestamp: "2025-10-03T14:32:00Z"
confidence: 0.87

reasoning_chain:
  - agent: "Design Agent"
    conclusion: "Dual side exits preferable to aft"
    sources:
      - "CS-25.803 Emergency Evacuation"
      - "BWB-Q100 CAD model ASM-047"
      - "Historical evacuation test data (A380, B787)"
    rule_mapping:
      - "CS-25.803(a)": "90-second evacuation requirement"
      - "CS-25.807(a)": "Type I exit requirements"

  - agent: "Operations Agent"
    conclusion: "Ground handling constraints favor side access"
    sources:
      - "Airport gate compatibility study"
      - "Turnaround time analysis"
    
uncertainty:
  - "BWB-specific evacuation data limited (prototype only)"
  - "Passenger behavior model assumes conventional aircraft"

alternatives:
  - config: "Aft exits with emergency slides"
    confidence: 0.74
    trade_offs: "Reduced turnaround time, increased slide maintenance"

human_review_required: true
reason: "Consequential safety decision affecting type certification"
```

### 7.2 Source Attribution

All evidence traces to:
- **Regulatory text**: specific paragraph of CS-25, 14 CFR, etc.
- **Technical data**: CAD models, FEA results, test reports (with SHA256 hash)
- **Prior art**: historical certification data, research literature
- **Expert input**: human SME consultations (timestamped, attributed)

### 7.3 FAA/EASA Mapping

Recommendations explicitly map to regulatory requirements:
- **CS-25 / 14 CFR Part 25**: Airworthiness Standards (Transport Category)
- **DO-178C / DO-254**: Software/Hardware Assurance
- **AMC/ACJ**: Acceptable Means of Compliance
- **EASA Opinions**: Emerging guidance on AI/ML

This enables:
- Certification authorities to trace ASI output to their frameworks
- Applicants to use ASI recommendations in certification basis
- Auditors to validate compliance independently

## 8. Safety Case as Data

### 8.1 Goal Structuring Notation (GSN)

ASI maintains a continuously updated GSN safety case (see **ASI_GSN_Safety_Case.gsn**):

**Top-Level Goal (G1):**
"ASI operates safely and within authority boundaries for aerospace advisory use"

**Sub-Goals:**
- **G2**: ASI generates accurate, evidence-backed recommendations
- **G3**: ASI respects hard authority boundaries (no live control)
- **G4**: ASI complies with EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF
- **G5**: ASI protects privacy and export-controlled information
- **G6**: ASI maintains transparency and auditability

**Strategies:**
- **S1**: Multi-layer verification (policy, safety monitors, human oversight)
- **S2**: Continuous evaluation (robustness, alignment, performance)
- **S3**: Independent assurance (external audit, red-teaming)

**Evidence:**
- **E1**: Policy-as-code test suite (100% pass rate)
- **E2**: Adversarial evaluation results (NIST AI RMF benchmark)
- **E3**: Red-team reports (quarterly, with remediation tracking)
- **E4**: External audit reports (annual, independent third party)

### 8.2 Continuous Evaluation

**Robustness Testing:**
- Adversarial prompts: jailbreak attempts, boundary probing
- Out-of-distribution inputs: queries outside training domain
- Stress testing: high load, concurrent requests, degraded dependencies
- Regression suite: automated daily checks of known failure modes

**Alignment Verification:**
- Principle consistency: outputs align with ASI Constitution
- Policy compliance: no violations of OPA/Rego rules
- Human feedback: expert review of recommendations, error reporting
- Comparative analysis: ASI vs. human expert agreement rates

**Public Benchmarks:**
- Open datasets: certification questions, design optimization problems
- Leaderboard: ASI performance vs. baseline methods
- Challenge problems: community-proposed test cases
- Transparency reports: quarterly publication of metrics
