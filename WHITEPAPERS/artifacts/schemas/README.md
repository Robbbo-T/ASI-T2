# Product Specification Schemas

## Quick Reference: Universal Product Example

**The Quantum Sensorial Skin** serves as the canonical worked example throughout this document. This universal product demonstrates how a single architectural approach adapts across all operational segments (AIR, SPACE, GROUND, SEA, DEFENSE) while maintaining common:

- **Computational paradigms** (CB for deterministic processing, QB for optimization, QC where quantum advantage exists)
- **Unit Elements** (SensorPatchUE, FusionNodeUE with standardized interfaces)
- **Federation patterns** (distributed mesh with autonomous coordination)
- **Temporal modeling** (anomaly prediction, root cause analysis)
- **State management** (immutable provenance chains via UTCS)

The example shows how deployment-specific configurations (sensor types, update rates, power constraints, regulatory standards) adapt to context while the core architecture remains constant. This universality is a key strength of the TFA V2 framework.

See the [complete worked example](#worked-example--the-quantum-sensorial-skin-universal-product) below for full specification details.

## Purpose and Scope

This directory provides standardized templates and schemas for defining ASI-T2 products within the TFA V2 architecture—spanning **computational paradigms** (CB/QB/QC), **compositional foundations** (UE), **coordination** (FE), **temporal modeling** (FWD), and **state management** (QS). Templates implement Master Whitepaper #1 guidance and apply across **AIR, SPACE, GROUND, DEFENSE, and CROSS**, with product-specific adaptations while maintaining architectural consistency.

### 5. Plan Gates

**FCR-1 Requirements:**
- SBOM generated (`syft` or equivalent)
- Demo videos/logs published with hashes
- DOI obtained (Zenodo or similar)
- Git tag signed (`git tag -s`)
- UTCS anchor created

**FCR-2 Requirements:**
- Reproducibility verified (one-click scripts)
- Coverage targets met (line/branch)
- Attestations generated (in-toto/SLSA-lite)
- 2 external validations obtained

## Validation

Before committing your product specification:

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('product_spec.yaml'))"

# Check required fields
grep -E "^product:|^trl:|^maturity:" product_spec.yaml

# Verify MAL interfaces
grep -E "control_bus|telemetry_bus|data_schema" product_spec.yaml
```

## Worked Example — The Quantum Sensorial Skin (Universal Product)

### Overview

The **Quantum Sensorial Skin** is a distributed sensor mesh that provides comprehensive environmental awareness across AIR, SPACE, GROUND, SEA, and DEFENSE applications. It demonstrates the full TFA V2 architecture stack with real-world complexity.

### Key Insights

1. **Architectural universality**: Same CB→QB→QC→UE→FE→FWD→QS flow applies across all domains
2. **Deployment specificity**: Sensor types, rates, power, and standards adapt to context

4. **Evidence consistency**: UTCS provenance chains work identically across all deployments
5. **Regulatory compliance**: Each deployment meets domain-specific certification requirements

This example demonstrates that TFA V2 is not just a theoretical framework but a practical architecture that scales from small embedded systems to large distributed networks.
