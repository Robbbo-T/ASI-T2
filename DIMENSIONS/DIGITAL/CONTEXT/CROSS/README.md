# Cross Context

Adapters, bridges, and standards integration that enable interoperability and communication across different digital systems and platforms.

## Operational Context

- **System Adapters**: Translation layers between different system architectures
- **Protocol Bridges**: Communication enablers across disparate protocols
- **Standards Integration**: Implementation of industry and regulatory standards
- **Interoperability Frameworks**: Cross-platform compatibility solutions

## Applications

Cross contexts ensure that diverse ASI-T2 systems can communicate, share data, and operate cohesively regardless of underlying technology differences.
