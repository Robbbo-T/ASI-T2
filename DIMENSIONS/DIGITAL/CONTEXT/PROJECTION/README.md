# Projection Context

Visualization systems, control room interfaces, and display technologies that project digital information into physical spaces.

## Operational Context

- **Control Room Systems**: Large-scale visualization and monitoring platforms
- **Display Technologies**: Advanced projection and display systems
- **Data Visualization**: Complex data rendered into comprehensible visual formats
- **Situational Awareness**: Real-time operational status and environmental monitoring

## Applications

Projection contexts enable operators to visualize complex system states, monitor operations, and make informed decisions through advanced display technologies.
