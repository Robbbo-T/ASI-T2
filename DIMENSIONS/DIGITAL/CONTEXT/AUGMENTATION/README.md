# Augmentation Context

Augmented reality, human-machine interfaces, and intelligent copilot systems that enhance human capabilities and system interactions.

## Operational Context

- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Overlay digital information onto physical environments
- **Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI)**: Advanced interaction systems for operators
- **Intelligent Copilots**: AI-assisted decision support and automation
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Real-time data overlays and contextual information

## Applications

Augmentation contexts improve human performance, reduce cognitive load, and enable more effective interaction with complex ASI-T2 systems.
