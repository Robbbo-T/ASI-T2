# Digital Context

Digital operational contexts and computational environments for ASI-T2 systems, covering virtual environments, quantum computing, augmentation technologies, and cross-platform integration.

## Structure

- **`VIRTUAL/`** — Simulators, digital twins, and synthetic environments
- **`QUANTUM/`** — Quantum machine learning, QUBO/BQM, and quantum state spaces
- **`AUGMENTATION/`** — AR/HMI interfaces and intelligent copilot systems
- **`EXTENSION/`** — Edge/cloud offload and distributed services
- **`PROJECTION/`** — Visualization systems and control room interfaces
- **`MIX/`** — Mixed reality compositions and hybrid environments
- **`CROSS/`** — Adapters, bridges, and standards integration

Each context provides specialized digital frameworks for specific operational requirements within the ASI-T2 ecosystem.
