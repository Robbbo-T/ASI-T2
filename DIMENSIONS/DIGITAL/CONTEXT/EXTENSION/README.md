# Extension Context

Edge computing, cloud offload capabilities, and distributed services that extend system capabilities beyond local hardware constraints.

## Operational Context

- **Edge Computing**: Distributed processing at network edges for reduced latency
- **Cloud Offload**: Scalable cloud-based computational resources
- **Distributed Services**: Microservices and API-based system architectures
- **Hybrid Computing**: Seamless integration of local and remote processing

## Applications

Extension contexts enable ASI-T2 systems to leverage unlimited computational resources and provide services across distributed networks with optimal performance.
