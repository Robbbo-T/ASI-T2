# Dimensions

Top-level classification of **digital** and **physical** contexts used across ASI-T2, providing foundational categorization for all systems, products, and operational environments.

## Structure

- **`DIGITAL/`** — Digital contexts, virtual environments, and software-based systems
- **`PHYSICAL/`** — Physical contexts, hardware systems, and tangible products

Each dimension provides specialized frameworks for categorizing and organizing ASI-T2 components according to their fundamental operational nature.
