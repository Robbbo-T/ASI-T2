# Product Type Context

Hardware classification by product type and operational domain, providing systematic organization of all physical ASI-T2 systems and components.

## Structure

- **`AIRCRAFT/`** — Manned and unmanned aircraft systems
- **`UAV/`** — Unmanned aerial vehicles and drone systems
- **`SATELLITE/`** — Space-based platforms and orbital systems
- **`GROUND_SYSTEM/`** — Ground-based infrastructure and control systems
- **`INFRASTRUCTURE/`** — Supporting infrastructure and facility systems
- **`COMPONENT/`** — Individual components and subsystems

Each product type represents a distinct category of physical systems with specific operational characteristics and deployment requirements.
