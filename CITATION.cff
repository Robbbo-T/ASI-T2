abstract: >
  ASI-T2 is a system-of-systems (SoS) integrating AMPEL360 BWB aircraft,
  GAIA SPACE satellite constellation, GAIA AIR swarm systems, Digital Platform,
  AMPEL 360PLUS space tourism, H₂/LH₂ Airport infrastructure, and Sustainable
  anti-speculative Finance. The common backbone is MAL (Master Application Layer/Logic)
  standardizing drivers, messaging, telemetry, health, logging and version/keys.
  QS/UTCS v5.0 provides the authoritative provenance spine with UiX Threading
  (Context/Content/Cache & Structure/Style/Sheet) bundling model. Each release
  includes verifiable evidence: signed tags, SBOMs (SPDX), DOIs, and immutable
  ledgers. The programme progresses through TFA V2 bridge (QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB)
  with FCR-1/FCR-2 gates requiring auditable, reproducible, and ethically
  governed releases per MAL-EEM/MAP-EEM.
