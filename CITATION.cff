abstract: >
  ASI-T2 is a system-of-systems (SoS) integrating AMPEL360 BWB aircraft,
  GAIA SPACE satellite constellation, GAIA AIR swarm systems, Digital Platform,
  AMPEL 360PLUS space tourism, H₂/LH₂ Airport infrastructure, and Sustainable
  anti-speculative Finance. The common backbone is MAL (Master Application Layer/Logic)
  standardizing drivers, messaging, telemetry, health, logging and version/keys.
  QS/UTCS provides end-to-end provenance from code to binaries with SBOMs, DOIs
  and signed tags. The programme progresses through TFA V2 (CB→QB→UE/FE→FWD→QS)
  with FCR-1/FCR-2 gates requiring verifiable evidence.
