# ASI-T2
## ARTIFICIAL SUPER INTELLIGENCE TRANSPONDERS for AEROSPACE SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRY TRANSITION

## Purpose and Author Mission

The ASI‑T2 repository positions itself as "Artificial Super Intelligence Transponders for Aerospace Sustainable Industry Transition". This long title encapsulates the vision: to design aerospace products and infrastructure that integrate classical computer‑aided engineering (CAx) with quantum‑optimised processes (QOx) to accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation.

The repository's maintainers call the overall architecture TFA (Top Federation Algorithm / Threading Final Assembly) and emphasise that every design and simulation step must be auditable through the Universal Traceability & Configuration System (UTCS) and Quantum Seal (QS), with strict compliance to ethical guidelines via the MAL‑EEM ethics and empathy guard.

The mission is not merely technical; it explicitly embeds ethics and empathy (preventing harmful AI/ML outputs) and sustainability metrics into every pipeline. The repository strives to create a holistic, interdisciplinary and scalable framework where classical aerospace engineering tasks are augmented by AI and quantum algorithms (QAIM‑2), documented through aviation standards (ATA chapters), packaged for onboard/off‑board systems (PAx), and traceable through cryptographic signatures and software bills of materials (SBOMs).

## Motivation

- **Sustainability**: The BWB‑Q100 programme aims for ~100‑passenger blended‑wing‑body aircraft that reduce fuel burn, emissions and noise while increasing circularity.

- **Quantum augmentation**: The Quantum‑Accelerated Industry Model 2 (QAIM‑2) is introduced to map classical CAx processes onto quantum‑optimised workflows, promising shorter design cycles, reduced computing costs and improved sustainability metrics.

- **Ethics & traceability**: The repository enforces the MAL‑EEM ethics guard and requires every quantum run or design change to emit UTCS/QS evidence packages and SBOMs, ensuring safe and trustworthy AI/ML practices.

## Repository Structure

The top‑level README acts as an index to fields, environments and products:

| Category | Purpose | Examples & notes |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **Fields** | Domains such as air_manned/transport, air_unmanned, communications, cyberdefense, quantum‑intelligence, transport‑civil and cross domains. Each field contains subtopics (e.g., transport/, mobility/ in air_manned). Many field directories are placeholders. | |
| **Environments** | Organises where systems operate. The Digital context includes VIRTUAL, QUANTUM, AUGMENTATION, EXTENSION, PROJECTION, MIX and CROSS subcontexts; the Physical context includes AIR, SEA, DEEP_SEA, GROUND, SPACE, DEEP_SPACE and CYBER. These categories help map digital tools to physical deployment. | |
| **Products** | The heart of the repository, grouping systems into families. Main product lines are AMPEL360 (manned aircraft), GAIA‑AIR (unmanned/hydrogen UAVs), GAIA‑SPACE (orbital robotics), GAIA‑SEA (marine systems), INFRANET (operating systems and infrastructure) and MISCELLANEOUS (legacy products). | |

## PAx – Packaging & Applications

The PAx structure defines how CAx/QOx outputs are packaged for on‑board and off‑board deployment. 

- **On‑board packaging**: Contains ARINC‑653/IMA manifests, A661 cockpit display definitions, A664/AFDX network configurations and real‑time OS requirements.
- **Off‑board packaging**: Includes OCI container descriptors for edge/cloud systems, digital twin services and maintenance operations.

Each package must include SBOMs, digital signatures (e.g., Sigstore/Cosign) and UTCS hashes. The repository provides example PAx folders under BWB‑Q100 (AAA and DDD domains).

## The BWB‑Q100 (Transport Civil × Air) Project

The BWB‑Q100 is currently the most detailed product in the repository. It targets a 100‑passenger blended wing body aircraft optimised for sustainability. The README uses a Domain → Process → ATA structure to organise engineering content. Each domain (15 total) represents a subsystem or discipline and includes three process folders:
- `cax/` for classical Computer‑Aided tools
- `qox/` for quantum‑optimised counterparts
- `ata/` for standard documentation according to ATA chapters

### Domain Catalogue

| Code | Domain name & purpose |
|------|-----------------------|
| AAA | Aerodynamics & Airframes: wing and fuselage aerodynamics, structural design. |
| AAP | Airport Adaptable Platforms: ground operations and airport integration for BWB aircraft. |
| CCC | Cockpit, Cabin & Cargo: human–machine interfaces, cabin systems, cargo logistics. |
| CQH | Cryogenics, Quantum & H₂: hydrogen storage, cryogenic systems and embedded quantum computing infrastructure. |
| DDD | Digital & Data Defense: cybersecurity, data protection and digital twin security. |
| EDI | Electronics & Digital Instruments: avionics and electronic systems. |
| EEE | Ecological Efficient Electrification: sustainable electrical systems. |
| EER | Environmental, Emissions & Remediation: environmental compliance and remediation strategies. |
| IIF | Industrial Infrastructure & Facilities: manufacturing and industrial systems. |
| IIS | Integrated Intelligence & Software: AI and software integration. |
| LCC | Linkages, Control & Communications: flight controls, communications and network systems. |
| LIB | Logistics, Inventory & Blockchain: supply‑chain management and traceability. |
| MEC | Mechanical Systems Modules: landing gear, mechanical assemblies. |
| OOO | OS, Ontologies & Office Interfaces: software and knowledge‑management frameworks. |
| PPP | Propulsion & Fuel System: engines, fuel storage and management. |

Each domain's `cax/` folder contains classical workflows—design (CAD), analysis (CAE/CFD), manufacturing (CAM/CAPP), virtual prototyping and product lifecycle management (PDM‑PLM). The `qox/` folder mirrors the CAx processes but focuses on encoding problems into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) or Binary Quadratic Models (BQM) and solving them using algorithms like QAOA, quantum annealing or VQE. The `ata/` folder houses official documentation, aligning with air‑transport standards (e.g., ATA‑20, ATA‑27, etc.).

## QAIM‑2: Connecting CAx and QOx

The Quantum‑Accelerated Industry Model 2 (QAIM‑2) describes how classical engineering pipelines transform into quantum‑optimised workflows.

### Classical CAx Development Pipeline
- Sequential
- Expert‑driven
- High HPC usage
- Siloed disciplines
- Mature tools

### QAIM‑Optimised Pipeline
- Integrated multidisciplinary workflow
- Uses AI, quantum assistance
- Surrogate modelling
- Parallel exploration with unified digital threads

In the QAIM‑2 framework, sustainability improvements come from reduced HPC/prototype energy usage, early integration of sustainability metrics and improved design quality. Integration and collaboration are enhanced via unified digital models, automated traceability and full CI/CD with AI co‑pilots. The framework acknowledges that quantum tools are still evolving (TRL < 9) and require hybrid adoption strategies.

## Workflows and Quantum Optimisation Process

The BWB‑Q100 project outlines a generic workflow:

1. **Model (CAx)**: Engineers design components using classical tools; these become commit objects in the domains/<code>/cax/ folder.
2. **Encode (QOx)**: Problems are converted into QUBO/BQM models and stored in qox/<phase>/problems/.
3. **Solve**: Quantum algorithms (e.g., QAOA or annealing) run to provide candidate solutions; results are saved under qox/<phase>/runs/<timestamp>/ with UTCS evidence.
4. **Document (ATA)**: The outcome, models and evidence are documented in the appropriate ata/ATA-xx/ folders.
5. **Gate**: A quality gate ensures the pull request includes UTCS anchors and passes MAL‑EEM ethics checks.

The detailed quantum optimisation process includes classical modelling, quantum problem encoding (problem analysis, QUBO formulation, penalty methods and validation), algorithm selection (matrix linking problem type to QAOA, annealing, VQE or HHL/QLSA), quantum execution with noise mitigation and hybrid processing, and documentation with UTCS evidence and sustainability metrics.

### Performance and Sustainability KPIs
- Target 5‑15% fuel‑efficiency improvement
- 10‑20% emissions reduction
- 20‑50% development time reduction

### Domain‑Specific Quantum Examples

**AAA – Wing design**
- Encode 30‑100 wing‑geometry variables into a QUBO to minimise drag and weight
- Solve with QAOA and refine classically
- Expecting 5‑15% drag reduction

**PPP – Engine operating point**
- Treat throttle settings and flight phases as variables
- Use quantum annealing and QAOA to optimise operating points for fuel and emission reductions

**MEC – Landing‑gear topology**
- Formulate FEA topology optimisation as a binary material‑distribution problem
- Combine VQE for material properties with QAOA for topology search
- Achieve 10‑20% weight reduction

## Glossary

The README supplies an extensive glossary for CAx and QOx terminology.

### CAx Definitions
Includes CAD, CAE, CFD, CAM, CAPP, VP, PDM‑PLM, SCM, MRP‑ERP, CIM, CAI, CAA, CASE, KBE, CAT and others.

### QOx Definitions
Describes how each CAx process maps to quantum algorithms (QUBO/BQM formulations solved via QAOA, annealing, VQE or HHL/QLSA). The glossary emphasises that QOx is not a copy of CAx but a complementary set of quantum‑enabled techniques.

## AQUA OS Aircraft Extension (INFRANET)

The AQUA OS Aircraft Extension belongs to the INFRANET product line and provides an aviation‑grade operating system that supports the ASI‑T2 framework. Its README includes UTCS metadata and declares the project's classification, certification basis and quantum integration level.

### Key Features
- **ARINC‑653 compliant partitioning**: For memory‑protected, time‑partitioned real‑time execution.
- **Deterministic networking**: Supporting AFDX, TSN and TTE protocols with guaranteed QoS.
- **Time and synchronisation services**: Providing robust PTP/TTE with Grandmaster switchover.
- **Security framework and Key Management System**: With optional Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) integration.
- **Evidence sealing**: Via UTCS/QS and health monitoring services.

The OS architecture shows a kernel providing time, network, security, evidence and I/O services over ARINC‑653 partitions, each hosting components such as a Quantum‑Assisted Fly‑by‑Wire (QAFbW) control, Navigation/Air Data, HMI, Maintenance and Quality Assurance components.

## Evaluation of Repository Status

### Strengths

- **Comprehensive vision**: The repository proposes a detailed conceptual framework linking classical aerospace engineering to quantum‑assisted optimisation, with sustainability and ethical considerations built‑in. The Domain → Process → ATA structure enforces traceability and mirrors aerospace certification workflows. Cross‑domain coordination guidelines and UTCS evidence embed reproducibility and compliance.

- **Holistic infrastructure**: Tools like AQUA OS provide the backbone for deploying quantum‑augmented software in safety‑critical environments. The PAx packaging scheme demonstrates how results are packaged for on‑board and off‑board use with SBOMs, signatures and container descriptors.

- **Quantum integration details**: The BWB‑Q100 README does more than propose quantum usage; it offers concrete examples of problem formulations, algorithm choices, KPIs and expected improvements. It recognises current hardware limitations and suggests hybrid adoption strategies.

### Weaknesses & Gaps

- **Placeholders and incomplete fields**: Many field directories such as quantum‑intelligence, communications and cyberdefense contain only placeholder files or are missing content. Even in the BWB‑Q100 domain directories, most cax and qox subfolders lack actual models or code. This suggests that the repository is currently more of an architectural template than a fully populated project.

- **Limited product maturity**: While the BWB‑Q100 README provides extensive descriptions, there are few actual implementation files (CAD models, QUBO problems or quantum runs). Other product lines (GAIA‑AIR, GAIA‑SPACE, GAIA‑SEA) and the process engine (QAIM) are largely unimplemented.

- **Absence of quantum algorithms**: The QAIM‑2 framework, although conceptually rich, lacks code or notebooks demonstrating QAOA/annealing implementations. Without such artefacts, it is difficult to validate claims about performance or sustainability improvements.

- **Complexity and barrier to entry**: The sheer volume of acronyms, special frameworks (TFA, QAIM‑2, UTCS, MAL‑EEM), and multi‑layered structure may hinder external contributors. Clear onboarding guides and simpler examples are needed.

## Suggested Next Steps for the Project

1. **Populate domain content**: Prioritise one or two domains (e.g., AAA and PPP) by including actual CAD models, CFD/FEA data sets, QUBO problem files and quantum‑run results. Show end‑to‑end pipelines—classical design, quantum encoding, solving and ATA documentation—to validate the QAIM‑2 concept.

2. **Develop the QAIM engine**: Create a repository or submodule under INFRANET/QAIM that provides Python notebooks and scripts implementing QAOA, annealing and VQE using open‑source quantum SDKs (Qiskit, PennyLane). Include benchmarking and integration with UTCS evidence.

3. **Complete missing field and environment pages**: Flesh out the placeholders in quantum‑intelligence, communications, cyberdefense and cross/process_engineering/QAIM‑2 directories. Provide at least high‑level descriptions and links to relevant standards, research papers or internal planning documents.

4. **Improve documentation and onboarding**: The project would benefit from a concise overview or whitepaper summarising the mission, frameworks and how to contribute. A quickstart guide with a simple example (e.g., supply‑chain optimisation using QUBO) could help new contributors understand the domain‑process‑ATA flow.

5. **Demonstrate ethics and empathy integration**: Provide an example of how the MAL‑EEM guard works in practice. For instance, show how a quantum optimisation run is checked for fairness, bias and safety using automatic analysis tools.

6. **Publish SBOMs and UTCS prototypes**: Provide real SBOM files and UTCS/QS metadata for a small set of components or container images. This would show the community how traceability and cryptographic sealing are implemented.

7. **Collaborate with domain experts**: Engage aerospace engineers, sustainability analysts, quantum computing researchers and ethicists to review the framework and provide feedback. Cross‑disciplinary collaboration is essential given the project's ambition.

## Conclusion

The robbbo‑t/ASI‑T2 repository is an ambitious attempt to fuse classical aerospace engineering with quantum computing and rigorous ethical/sustainability frameworks. Its structure—Fields → Environments → Products; Domain → Process → ATA; CAx → QOx—reflects a meticulous approach to organising complex engineering projects. The BWB‑Q100 README stands out as a detailed blueprint illustrating how quantum optimisation could reshape aircraft design and manufacturing, and the AQUA OS demonstrates readiness for safety‑critical deployment. However, the repository currently serves more as a framework and vision document than a repository of functioning code or data. Completing the missing components, providing end‑to‑end examples and engaging a broader community will be essential for realising the author's mission of ethical, sustainable and quantum‑augmented aerospace systems.

PAx structure is currently implemented in BWB-Q100 domains:

- **[BWB-Q100/AAA/pax/](./PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/AMPEL360_AIR_TRANSPORT/BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/pax/)** — Aerodynamics & Airframes packaging (complete: OB/, OFF/, schemas/, scripts/)
- **[BWB-Q100/DDD/pax/](./PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/AMPEL360_AIR_TRANSPORT/BWB-Q100/domains/DDD/pax/)** — Digital & Data Defense packaging (partial: OB/ only)

#### Current Directory Contents

**AAA/pax/** (Complete implementation):
```
pax/
├── OB/manifests/         # partition.example.yaml
├── OFF/oci/             # ground.oml.exporter.yaml
├── schemas/             # package.schema.json
└── scripts/             # validate_pax.py
```

**DDD/pax/** (Minimal implementation):
```
pax/
└── OB/                  # Basic on-board structure
```

### Quality Standards

- **SBOM mandatory**: SPDX/CycloneDX for all OB/OFF components
- **Digital signatures**: sigstore/cosign, in-toto attestations, SLSA-L3 compliance
- **UTCS traceability**: canonical_hash and QS integration in all manifests
- **Security principles**: least privilege, readonly root filesystems, non-root execution
