## Models (`models/`)

### Capacity Model

**Objective**: Determine storage and throughput requirements

**Inputs**:
- Daily flight operations
- Aircraft fuel capacity (AMPEL360 BWB: ~50-100 tons H₂)
- Turnaround time targets
- Reserve margins

**Outputs**:
- Storage capacity (tons LH₂)
- Vaporization capacity (tons/hour)
- Distribution pipeline sizing
- Redundancy requirements

**Example Calculation**:
```
Flights per day: 20
H₂ per flight: 75 tons
Daily demand: 1500 tons H₂
Storage capacity: 3000 tons (2-day reserve)
Peak flow rate: 150 tons/hour (10 simultaneous fueling)
```

### Flow Model

**Objective**: Model hydrogen flow from storage to aircraft

**Components**:
- LH₂ storage tanks (cryogenic, -253°C)
- Vaporizers (if gaseous delivery)
- Compression (if high-pressure delivery)
- Distribution manifolds
- Fueling trucks or hydrants

**Key Metrics**:
- Flow rate: 5-10 tons/min per station
- Temperature control: ±2°C
- Pressure regulation: ±0.5 bar
- Boil-off management: <0.5% per day

### Turnaround MDO (Multidisciplinary Design Optimization)

**Objective**: Minimize turnaround time with safety constraints

**Variables**:
- Fueling sequence
- Crew positioning
- Safety checks
- Simultaneous operations

**Constraints**:
- Safety distances
- Crew certification
- Equipment availability
- Weather conditions

**Target**: <30 min turnaround time (comparable to kerosene)
