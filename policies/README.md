# Policies

Compliance policies and policy-as-code framework for the IDEALE-EU Federation.

## Overview

This directory contains the **federation-wide compliance policies** that govern data classification, export control, privacy, and security practices. These policies are **enforced as code** through CI/CD workflows and automated validation.

## Policy Documents

### 1. Data Classification

**File**: [DATA_CLASSIFICATION.md](./DATA_CLASSIFICATION.md)

Four-tier classification system for federation artifacts.

**Classification Levels**:
- **OPEN** üåç: Public, no restrictions
- **SHARED** ü§ù: Federation members only, NDA required
- **RESTRICTED** üîí: Vetted organizations, bilateral agreements
- **CONTROLLED** üö´: Export-controlled (ITAR/EAR/Dual-Use), off-repo

**Key Requirements**:
- All artifacts must declare `classification` in manifest
- CONTROLLED content cannot be committed to repository (hash references only)
- Classification changes require change control approval
- Automated enforcement via `.github/workflows/validate-manifests.yml`

**Usage**:
```yaml
# In index.extracted.yaml
classification: INTERNAL‚ÄìEVIDENCE-REQUIRED
```

---

### 2. Export Control

**File**: [EXPORT_CONTROL.md](./EXPORT_CONTROL.md)

Compliance framework for ITAR, EAR, and EU Dual-Use regulations.

**Regulatory Frameworks**:
- **ITAR** (22 CFR 120-130): U.S. defense articles and services
- **EAR** (15 CFR 730-774): Dual-use items and emerging technologies
- **EU Dual-Use** (Regulation 2021/821): European dual-use export controls

**Required Declarations**:
```yaml
# In index.extracted.yaml
export_control:
  itar: false              # ITAR-controlled?
  ear: "NLR"               # EAR: NLR, EAR99, or ECCN (e.g., 9E003)
  eu_dual_use: "none"      # EU: none, or annex code (e.g., 9E003.a)
```

**Compliance Requirements**:
- Export control review required for RESTRICTED artifacts
- Empowered Export Control Officer approval for CONTROLLED
- Training mandatory for contributors handling controlled content
- Automated checks prevent CONTROLLED content in public repos

---

### 3. Privacy

**File**: [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md)

GDPR compliance and EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework implementation.

**Key Topics**:
- **GDPR Compliance**: Legal basis, consent, data subject rights
- **EU-U.S. DPF**: Lawful transatlantic data transfers
- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: Alternative transfer mechanism
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimize, anonymize, pseudonymize
- **Data Subject Rights**: Access, rectification, erasure, portability

**Personal Data Handling**:
```yaml
# Mark artifacts containing personal data
metadata:
  contains_personal_data: true
  data_subjects: ["contributors", "testers"]
  legal_basis: "consent"  # or legitimate_interest, contract, etc.
  retention_period: "2_years"
```

**Privacy Requirements**:
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for high-risk processing
- Data Protection Officer (DPO) consultation
- Breach notification within 72 hours
- Anonymize/pseudonymize by default

---

### 4. Security

**File**: [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)

Supply chain security, SLSA framework, and NIS2 cybersecurity requirements.

**Security Frameworks**:
- **SLSA Level 3+**: Build provenance and integrity
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials (SPDX/CycloneDX)
- **Sigstore**: Keyless signing with OIDC
- **NIS2**: EU cybersecurity directive compliance

**Security Requirements**:
```yaml
# PAx packages must include
pax/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sbom/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.spdx.json      # SBOM required
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ signatures/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.sig             # Sigstore signature
```

**Mandatory Practices**:
- Vulnerability scanning (Grype, Trivy) before release
- Cryptographic signing of all releases
- Dependency pinning and SBOM generation
- Incident response plan (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md))
- NIS2 incident reporting within 24 hours

---

## Policy Enforcement

### Automated Validation

Policies are enforced through CI/CD workflows:

| Policy | Workflow | Enforcement |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Data Classification | `validate-manifests.yml` | FAIL if CONTROLLED in public repo |
| Export Control | `validate-manifests.yml` | WARN if missing declarations |
| Privacy | Manual review | REQUIRE DPO approval for personal data |
| Security | `sbom-attest.yml` | FAIL if missing SBOM/signatures |

### Manual Gates

Some policies require human review:

- **Export Control**: Empowered Officer approval for RESTRICTED/CONTROLLED
- **Privacy**: DPO consultation for high-risk processing
- **Security**: Incident Commander for security breaches
- **Classification**: Change Control Board for reclassification

---

## Policy-as-Code

Policies are implemented as executable checks:

### Example: Classification Check

```python
# In .github/workflows/validate-manifests.yml
def check_classification(manifest):
    classification = manifest.get("classification")
    
    if not classification:
        return "ERROR: Missing classification field"
    
    if classification == "CONTROLLED":
        # Check if in public repo
        if repo.visibility == "public":
            return "FAIL: CONTROLLED content in public repo"
    
    return "PASS"
```

### Example: Export Control Check

```python
def check_export_control(manifest):
    export = manifest.get("export_control", {})
    
    if export.get("itar") == True:
        # Require off-repo with hash reference
        if "hash_reference" not in manifest:
            return "FAIL: ITAR content requires hash reference"
    
    if export.get("ear") not in ["NLR", "EAR99"] and not export.get("ear", "").startswith("ECCN"):
        return "WARN: EAR classification unclear"
    
    return "PASS"
```

## Compliance Monitoring

### Audit Trail

All policy-relevant events are logged:

- Classification changes (with Change Control Board ticket)
- Export control reviews (with officer approval)
- Privacy assessments (with DPO sign-off)
- Security incidents (with IR case number)

### Compliance Dashboard

Track policy adherence across federation:

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Artifacts with classification | 100% | [Auto-updated by CI] |
| Export control declarations | 100% | [Auto-updated by CI] |
| SBOM coverage (releases) | 100% | [Auto-updated by CI] |
| Vulnerability scan (weekly) | 100% | [Auto-updated by CI] |
| Security incidents (MTTD) | <24h | [Manual tracking] |
