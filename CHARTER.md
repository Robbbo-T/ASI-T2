# IDEALE-EU Federation Charter

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01  
**Framework:** IDEALE (Intelligence, Defense, Energy/Ecology, Aerospace, Logistics, Europe)

---

## Mission Statement

IDEALE-EU establishes a **standards-first, compliance-aware, open federation** for aerospace sustainable industry transition, serving as the technical commons for US-EU collaboration in aviation, space, and maritime systems.

This federation provides a lawful, reproducible path for:
- **Safety certification**: Aligning with FAA↔EASA bilateral safety frameworks
- **Cybersecurity compliance**: Meeting NIS2 and dual-use export control requirements
- **Data protection**: Lawful cross-Atlantic personal data transfers via EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
- **Supply chain assurance**: SLSA-based provenance, SBOM attestations, and verifiable credentials

---

## Founding Principles

### 1. Standards-First Architecture
All artifacts conform to international standards:
- **Aviation**: S1000D, ATA iSpec 2200, ARINC-653
- **Engineering**: STEP AP242, QIF, OSLC
- **Security**: SPDX, CycloneDX, Sigstore, SLSA
- **Semantics**: PROV-O, QUDT

### 2. Regulatory Bridge
The federation bridges FAA and EASA certification processes through:
- Mutual recognition of Type Inspection Procedures (TIP)
- Material Acceptance Guidance (MAG) alignment
- Digital twin validation for certification artifacts
- Reproducible evidence chains (UTCS/QS)

### 3. Ethical AI & Autonomy
All intelligent systems operate under **MAL-EEM** (Multi-Agent Logic with Ethics and Empathy Module):
- Human oversight for critical decisions
- Explainable AI outputs
- Privacy-by-design
- Dual-use safeguards

### 4. Open Federation Model
- **Neutral governance**: Multi-stakeholder council (public interest, national labs, academia)
- **Technical meritocracy**: TSC per line of effort (AIR/SEA/SPACE/INFRANET)
- **RFC-driven evolution**: Recorded decisions (ADRs) with public review
- **Modular participation**: Organizations contribute to specific domains without full-stack commitment

### 5. Security & Trust
- **Policy-as-code**: Export control, data classification, and privacy enforced via CI/CD
- **Supply chain transparency**: SBOM and attestations for all deliverables
- **Zero-trust architecture**: Least privilege, signed artifacts, immutable audit trails
- **Incident response**: Coordinated disclosure aligned with NIS2

---

## Governance Structure

### IDEALE Council
Strategic oversight body comprising:
- Government agencies (civil aviation authorities, research labs)
- Academic institutions (aerospace engineering, quantum computing, ethics)
- Industry advisors (OEMs, suppliers, operators)
- Public interest representatives (environmental, labor, passenger rights)

**Responsibilities:**
- Charter amendments (supermajority vote)
- TSC appointment and oversight
- Strategic roadmap approval
- Conflict resolution escalation

### Technical Steering Committees (TSC)
Domain-specific technical leadership:
- **AIR TSC**: Manned and unmanned aircraft
- **SEA TSC**: Marine and underwater systems
- **SPACE TSC**: Orbital and deep-space platforms
- **INFRANET TSC**: Ground infrastructure, quantum computing, networks

**Responsibilities:**
- Technical roadmap for assigned line of effort
- CODEOWNERS approval
- RFC review and acceptance
- CI/CD quality gates

### Working Groups
Self-organized teams for specific products/domains:
- **BWB-Q100**: Blended-wing-body aircraft
- **AQUA-OS**: Avionics operating system
- **QAIM**: Quantum-accelerated integrated manufacturing
- **LH2-CORRIDOR**: Liquid hydrogen infrastructure

---

## Membership & Participation

### Open Participation
- **Public artifacts**: OPEN classification accessible to all
- **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: Required for code/documentation contributions
- **Code of Conduct**: Mandatory adherence for all participants

### Tiered Access
- **OPEN**: Public internet, no restrictions
- **SHARED**: Registered federation members, NDA
- **RESTRICTED**: Vetted organizations, bilateral agreements
- **CONTROLLED**: Off-repo references only, strict export control

---

## Certification & Compliance

### FAA↔EASA Mutual Recognition
The federation maintains alignment with:
- **Type Certificates (TC)**: Design approval
- **Supplemental Type Certificates (STC)**: Modifications
- **Production Certificates (PC)**: Manufacturing quality
- **Airworthiness Directives (AD)**: Continued safety

### NIS2 Cybersecurity
All **INFRANET** and **IIS** (software/networking) domains comply with:
- Risk assessment and incident reporting
- Supply chain security measures
- Encryption and access control
- Business continuity planning

### Export Control
Explicit tagging in `index.extracted.yaml`:
```yaml
export_control:
  itar: false
  ear: "NLR"
  eu_dual_use: "none"
```
CI/CD enforces:
- ITAR content never committed to public repos
- EAR/EU dual-use tracked with approved licenses
- Cryptography export notifications filed as required

---

## Intellectual Property

### Multi-License Framework
- **Code**: Apache-2.0 (permissive, patent grant)
- **Documentation**: CC-BY-4.0 (attribution, derivative works allowed)
- **Hardware**: CERN-OHL-S-2.0 (strong reciprocal, prevents proprietization)
- **AI Models**: OpenRAIL (responsible AI license with use restrictions)

### Patent Policy
Contributors grant non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses for patents essential to implementing federation standards. Defensive termination provisions apply.

### Trade Secrets
Members may withhold trade secrets but must provide:
- **Black-box interfaces**: API/protocol specifications
- **Validation test suites**: Conformance without disclosure
- **Reference hashes**: CONTROLLED artifacts tracked via digest

---

## Amendment Process

1. **Proposal**: Any council member or TSC may propose amendments
2. **Public Comment**: 60-day review period
3. **Council Vote**: Supermajority (2/3) required for charter changes
4. **Effective Date**: 30 days after approval

---

## Dissolution

In the event of dissolution:
1. All OPEN/SHARED artifacts placed under permanent open licenses
2. RESTRICTED artifacts returned to contributors or archived under escrow
3. Infrastructure donated to neutral non-profit (Linux Foundation, Eclipse Foundation)
