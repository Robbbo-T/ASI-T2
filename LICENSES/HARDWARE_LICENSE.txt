CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers
and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify,
share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version
2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive);
and two reciprocal licences: this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal) and
CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified
form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or
their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.

1. Definitions

1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-S.

1.2 'Compatible Licence' means
    a) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or
    b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or
    c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it applies
       as licensed under CERN-OHL-S provided that on Conveyance of any such
       Source, or any associated Product You treat the Source in question as
       being licensed under CERN-OHL-S.

1.3 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital code which
    can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product for use,
    Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is expressed. It may
    include Notices.

1.4 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available under this
    Licence.

1.5 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object, whether in
    finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or processing
    of Covered Source.

1.6 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture,
    assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another Product
    or otherwise.

1.7 'Available Component' means any part, sub-assembly, library or code which:
    a) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible Licence; or
    b) is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing it is first
       Conveyed, to You and any other prospective licensees
       i) with sufficient rights and information (including any configuration
          and programming files and information about its characteristics and
          interfaces) to enable it either to be Made itself, or to be sourced
          and used to Make the Product; or
       ii) as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to design or Make
           the Product.

1.8 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make a Product,
    in the preferred form for making modifications, including necessary
    installation and interfacing information both for the Product, and for any
    included Available Components. If the format is proprietary, it must also be
    made available in a format (if the proprietary tool can create it) which is
    viewable with a tool available to potential licensees and licensed under a
    licence approved by the Free Software Foundation or the Open Source
    Initiative. Complete Source need not include the Source of any Available
    Component, provided that You include in the Complete Source sufficient
    information to enable a recipient to Make or source and use the Available
    Component to Make the Product.

APPLICATION TO IDEALE-EU

This license applies to all hardware designs, schematics, PCB layouts, mechanical
CAD files (STEP, IGES, native), and other open hardware artifacts within the
IDEALE-EU federation repository.

This includes but is not limited to:
- Electronic schematics and PCB designs
- Mechanical CAD files (airframes, structures, mechanisms)
- 3D models for manufacturing (CAM toolpaths, STL files)
- FPGA/ASIC designs (HDL source code)
- Test fixtures and jigs
- Manufacturing specifications

The CERN-OHL-S was chosen for its **strong reciprocal** provisions, ensuring that:
1. Modifications to hardware designs remain open
2. Products made from designs must provide Complete Source
3. Derivative works cannot be closed or proprietized
4. Commercial use is permitted (with reciprocal obligations)
