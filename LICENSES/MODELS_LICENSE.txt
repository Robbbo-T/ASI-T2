PREAMBLE

This License governs the use of the Model and any derivatives or applications
thereof. The Model is subject to additional use restrictions as set forth in
Attachment A ("Use Restrictions").

The goal of this License is to promote open and responsible AI development. While
the Model is made available under permissive terms, Users must comply with ethical
use restrictions to prevent harmful applications.

SECTION I: DEFINITIONS

1. "License" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution
   as defined in this document.

2. "Model" means the trained machine learning model, including weights, parameters,
   architecture specifications, and associated documentation made available under
   this License.

3. "Derivative Models" means any model that is trained using the Model (including
   fine-tuning, distillation, or other transfer learning techniques).

4. "Application" means any software, system, or service that incorporates or uses
   the Model to generate outputs.

5. "Use Restrictions" means the restrictions on use set forth in Attachment A.

6. "Harmful Use" means any use of the Model that violates the Use Restrictions.

SECTION II: GRANT OF LICENSE

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, including the Use Restrictions,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
license to:

a) Use the Model for research, development, and commercial purposes;
b) Modify the Model (including fine-tuning and other adaptations);
c) Create Derivative Models;
d) Distribute the Model and Derivative Models; and
e) Create Applications using the Model.

---

SECTION III: USE RESTRICTIONS (See Attachment A)

You agree that You will not use the Model or Derivative Models, nor allow others
to use them, for any Harmful Use as defined in Attachment A.

If You distribute the Model or Derivative Models, You must:
a) Include a copy of this License;
b) Ensure that recipients are bound by the same Use Restrictions;
c) Provide notice that the Model is subject to Use Restrictions.

   - Creating deepfakes or synthetic media intended to deceive
   - Generating hate speech, harassment, or discriminatory content
   - Producing content that incites violence or self-harm
   - Creating child sexual abuse material (CSAM)

3. **Safety-Critical Systems Without Certification**
   - Deployment in aviation, space, or autonomous vehicles without:
     * Appropriate certification (DO-178C, DO-254, etc.)
     * Human oversight and fail-safe mechanisms
     * Validation against safety requirements
   - Use in medical diagnosis or treatment without regulatory approval

4. **Privacy Violations**
   - Unauthorized collection or processing of personal data
   - De-anonymization or re-identification of individuals
   - Surveillance without consent or legal authorization
   - Biometric recognition for mass surveillance

5. **Manipulation and Disinformation**

   - Lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS)
   - Autonomous targeting or engagement without human control
   - Weapons prohibited by international humanitarian law

7. **Discrimination**
   - Applications that discriminate based on protected characteristics
     (race, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, etc.)
   - Biased decision-making in hiring, lending, housing, or criminal justice
   - Social scoring systems that violate human rights

8. **Exploitation**
   - Fraudulent or deceptive practices

APPLICATION TO IDEALE-EU

This license applies to all trained AI/ML models within the IDEALE-EU federation,
including:
- Neural networks (weights, parameters, architecture)
- Classical ML models (decision trees, SVMs, etc.)
- Optimization models (QUBO, BQM encodings)
- Simulation models (CFD surrogates, digital twins)

**Additional IDEALE-EU Requirements:**

1. **Model Cards Required**
   All distributed models must include a Model Card documenting:
   - Intended use cases
   - Training data characteristics
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, bias, fairness)
   - Limitations and failure modes
   - Ethical considerations

2. **Explainability**
   Safety-critical models must provide:
   - Feature importance scores
   - Counterfactual explanations
   - Uncertainty quantification

EXPORT CONTROL NOTICE

AI/ML models may be subject to export control:
- US: EAR Category 3E001 (software for development of AI)
- EU: Dual-Use Regulation, Category 4E001

High-performance models (>10^12 parameters) may require export licenses.
