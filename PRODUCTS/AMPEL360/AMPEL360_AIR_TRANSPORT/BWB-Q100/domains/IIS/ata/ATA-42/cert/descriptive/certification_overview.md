# BWB-Q100 IMA Certification Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the certification approach for the BWB-Q100 Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) system.

## System Description

The BWB-Q100 IMA system provides a shared computing platform for multiple aircraft functions, implementing robust partitioning to ensure independence between hosted applications.

## Certification Basis

- **Primary Standards**: DO-178C, DO-254, DO-297, ARP4754B, ARP4761A
