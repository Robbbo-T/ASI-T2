# AFDX Redundancy Test Report

## Test Objective
Verify the AFDX network implementation meets dual-active redundancy requirements per ARINC 664 specification.

## Test Environment
- **Hardware**: BWB-Q100 AFDX Test Network v1.0
- **Switches**: 2x AFDX switches (dual-active configuration)
- **Test Equipment**: 
  - AFDX Analyzer: AIM AC-664
  - Traffic Generator: Spirent TestCenter
  - Network Analyzer: Wireshark with AFDX plugin

## Test Parameters
| Parameter | Specification | Measured | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Redundancy Mode | Dual-Active | Dual-Active | ✅ Pass |
| Health Check Interval | 10 ms | 10 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Branch Loss Window | 50 ms | 48 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Max Acceptable Loss | 0.1% | 0.05% | ✅ Pass |
| Recovery Timeout | 100 ms | 95 ms | ✅ Pass |

## Test Procedure
1. Configure dual-active redundancy with health monitoring
2. Generate traffic on both A and B branches
3. Simulate branch A failure (disconnect cable)
4. Measure frame loss and recovery time
5. Restore branch A and verify resynchronization
6. Repeat test for branch B failure

## Test Results

### Branch A Failure Test
| Metric | Specification | Measured | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Frames Lost | ≤0.1% | 0.05% | ✅ Pass |
| Recovery Time | ≤100 ms | 95 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Frame Order | Maintained | Maintained | ✅ Pass |
| Duplicate Frames | None detected | None detected | ✅ Pass |

### Branch B Failure Test
| Metric | Specification | Measured | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Frames Lost | ≤0.1% | 0.04% | ✅ Pass |
| Recovery Time | ≤100 ms | 92 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Frame Order | Maintained | Maintained | ✅ Pass |
| Duplicate Frames | None detected | None detected | ✅ Pass |

### Dual-Active Performance
| Metric | Branch A | Branch B | Status |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Bandwidth Utilization | 48% | 47% | ✅ Pass |
| Frame Loss | 0% | 0% | ✅ Pass |
| Jitter | 45 µs | 43 µs | ✅ Pass |

## Issues Identified
1. **Minor**: Slight asymmetry in bandwidth utilization (48% vs 47%)
   - Resolution: Within acceptable limits, no action required
2. **Minor**: Recovery time varies slightly between branches (95ms vs 92ms)
   - Resolution: Within specification, no impact on system operation

## Conclusion
✅ **TEST PASSED**
The AFDX dual-active redundancy implementation meets all ARINC 664 requirements. Frame loss during branch failure is within acceptable limits, and recovery time meets specification.
