# ATA-42 OS General Manual

## Overview

This manual provides general information about the BWB-Q100 Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) Operating System (AQUA-OS). The operating system implements ARINC 653 partitioning standards to provide a safe and secure platform for flight-critical applications.

3. [Key Features](#key-features)
4. [Standards Compliance](#standards-compliance)

## General Description

The BWB-Q100 IMA Operating System provides a partitioned execution environment compliant with ARINC 653 standards. This system enables robust time and space partitioning for flight-critical applications.

### Purpose

The operating system serves as the foundation for all IMA applications, providing:

- Deterministic scheduling of partition execution
- Memory protection and isolation between partitions
- Health monitoring and fault management
- Inter-partition communication services
- I/O management for avionics interfaces

### Design Assurance Level

The operating system kernel is developed to Design Assurance Level A (DAL-A) in accordance with DO-178C standards for software considerations in airborne systems and embedded complex electronic hardware.

## Design Overview

### Architecture

The AQUA-OS implements a microkernel architecture with separation kernel capabilities. This design ensures that failures in one partition cannot affect other partitions, meeting the safety requirements for DAL-A systems.

### Major Components

1. **Separation Kernel**: Enforces time and space partitioning
2. **Partition Manager**: Manages partition lifecycle and scheduling
3. **Communication Manager**: Inter-partition communication services
4. **I/O Manager**: Device drivers and I/O services
5. **Health Monitor**: Fault detection and system health management

### Design Principles

The design follows these key principles:

- Minimal trusted computing base
- Separation of concerns between kernel and partitions
- Deterministic behavior for real-time operations
- Formal verification of critical properties

## Key Features

### Time Partitioning

The operating system provides deterministic scheduling with:

- Fixed major frame and partition windows
- Non-preemptive execution within windows
- Guaranteed CPU time allocation
- Configurable scheduling via XML configuration

### Space Partitioning

Memory isolation is enforced through:

- Hardware MMU/MPU protection
- Static memory allocation at initialization
- No dynamic allocation in kernel
- Protected partition memory regions

### Health Monitoring

Comprehensive fault detection includes:

- Partition error detection and recovery
- System health monitoring
- Configurable error responses
- Fault isolation and containment

### Communication

Inter-partition communication supports:

- Sampling ports (latest value)
- Queuing ports (FIFO buffered)
- Virtual channels for logical connections
- Deterministic message delivery

### I/O Management

The OS manages avionics interfaces including:

- AFDX (ARINC 664 Part 7)
- ARINC 429
- Discrete I/O
- Serial interfaces

## Standards Compliance

### ARINC 653

Full compliance with ARINC 653 Avionics Application Software Standard Interface including:

- Partition management API
- Communication API
- Time management API
- Health monitoring API

### DO-178C

Software development follows DO-178C at DAL-A level with:

- Requirements-based development
- Design and code standards
- Verification and validation
- Configuration management
- Quality assurance

### DO-326A / ED-202A

Security development follows airborne security standards:

- Security risk assessment
- Security development assurance
- Security verification

### ED-112A

Compliance with security processes for airborne systems and equipment certification.
