## Overview

DO-330 provides guidance for qualifying software tools used in the development or verification of airborne software and airborne electronic hardware.

## Tool Qualification Levels (TQL)

- **TQL-1**: Tool can insert errors and errors are not detected
- **TQL-2**: Tool can insert errors but errors are detected
- **TQL-3**: Tool can fail to detect errors in requirements
- **TQL-4**: Tool can fail to detect errors in design
- **TQL-5**: Tool can fail to detect errors in code

## BWB-Q100 Application
