# ED-112A Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

This security assessment demonstrates compliance with ED-112A (Security Processes for Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification) for the AQUA-OS operating system at Security Level 1.

## Threat Assessment

### Identified Threats

| Threat ID | Description | Severity | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| THR-001 | Unauthorized code execution | Critical | Secure boot, code signing |
| THR-002 | Memory corruption attacks | High | MMU protection, stack guards |
| THR-003 | Denial of service | High | Resource limits, health monitoring |
| THR-004 | Information disclosure | High | Encryption, access control |
| THR-005 | Privilege escalation | Critical | MAC, capability system |
| THR-006 | Supply chain compromise | High | SBOM, signature verification |
| THR-007 | Side-channel attacks | Medium | Constant-time crypto |
| THR-008 | Quantum computing attacks | Critical | Post-quantum cryptography |

### Threat Model

Adversary capabilities considered:
- Physical access to aircraft
- Network access to avionics bus
- Compromised maintenance equipment
- Nation-state capabilities
- Quantum computers (future threat)

## Security Architecture Assessment

### Secure Boot

**Assessment**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- Multi-stage verified boot
- Hardware root of trust
- Post-quantum signatures (Dilithium-5)
- Tamper detection

**Evidence**: [Secure Boot Test Results](../../testing/test_results/tr_security_20240520.md)

### Cryptography

**Assessment**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- Quantum-ready algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium)
- Approved algorithms (AES-256, SHA-3)
- Hardware acceleration
- Secure key management

**Evidence**: [Cryptographic Validation](crypto/validation.pdf)

### Access Control

**Assessment**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- Multi-level security (MLS)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
- Capability-based security

**Evidence**: [Access Control Tests](../../testing/test_results/)

### Isolation

**Assessment**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- Hardware-enforced partitioning
- MMU protection
- Separation kernel
- No information leakage demonstrated

**Evidence**: [Isolation Test Results](../../testing/test_results/)

- Independent security review completed
- All findings resolved

### Static Analysis

- Zero high-severity findings
- Medium findings reviewed and justified
- Continuous monitoring in place

### Fuzzing

- 1000+ hours of fuzzing
- No crashes or hangs
- All findings investigated

## Compliance Matrix

| ED-112A Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---------------------|--------|----------|
| Security Risk Assessment | ✅ Complete | [SRA-001](sra/SRA-001.pdf) |
