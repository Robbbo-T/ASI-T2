# DO-330 Tool Qualification Report

## Overview
This report documents the qualification of software tools used in the development and verification of the AQUA-OS operating system per DO-330 requirements.

## Qualified Tools

### Compiler Toolchain

| Tool | Version | TQL | Purpose |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| GCC PowerPC | 11.3.0 | TQL-1 | Code generation |
| GNU Binutils | 2.38 | TQL-1 | Linking, assembly |
| GNU Make | 4.3 | TQL-5 | Build automation |

### Verification Tools

| Tool | Version | TQL | Purpose |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| gcov | 11.3.0 | TQL-1 | Code coverage analysis |
| Bullseye Coverage | 8.25 | TQL-1 | MC/DC coverage |
| LDRA Testbed | 9.7.1 | TQL-1 | Static analysis |
| VectorCAST | 2023 | TQL-1 | Unit testing |

### Analysis Tools

## Tool Qualification Data

### Compiler (TQL-1)

**Tool Operational Requirements:**
- Generate correct object code from C source
- Support PowerPC e500mc instruction set
- Optimize without changing semantics
- Produce DWARF debug information

**Verification:**
- 500+ test cases from compiler test suite
- 100+ aviation-specific test cases
- All tests passed
- No known defects affecting certification

**Evidence:**
- [Tool Qualification Plan](tql/compiler_plan.pdf)
- [Tool Operational Requirements](tql/compiler_tor.pdf)
- [Tool Verification Results](tql/compiler_results.pdf)

### Coverage Tools (TQL-1)

**Tool Operational Requirements:**
- Accurately measure statement coverage
- Accurately measure decision coverage
- Accurately measure MC/DC coverage
- Produce traceable results

**Verification:**
- Known coverage scenarios tested
- Results compared with manual analysis
- 100% accuracy demonstrated

**Evidence:**
- [Coverage Tool Plan](tql/coverage_plan.pdf)
- [Coverage Tool Results](tql/coverage_results.pdf)

## Tool Error Impact

All TQL-1 tools have been analyzed for potential errors:

| Tool | Potential Error | Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Compiler | Incorrect code generation | Extensive testing, comparison with reference |
| Coverage | False positive coverage | Manual verification of critical paths |
| Static Analysis | False negatives | Multiple tool correlation |

## Compliance Statement

All development and verification tools have been qualified in accordance with DO-330 requirements. Tool qualification data has been provided to the certification authority.
