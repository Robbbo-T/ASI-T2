# DO-178C Standard Summary

## Overview

DO-178C (Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Airborne Equipment Certification) is the primary standard for software development in aviation. It defines objectives and activities for developing software that performs its intended function with a level of confidence appropriate to its criticality.

## Design Assurance Levels (DAL)

| Level | Failure Condition | Development Rigor | Examples |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| DAL-A | Catastrophic | Highest | Flight control (FBW) |
| DAL-B | Hazardous | High | Navigation |
| DAL-C | Major | Moderate | Displays |
| DAL-D | Minor | Low | Maintenance |
| DAL-E | No Effect | Minimal | Ground tools |

**AQUA-OS Kernel**: DAL-A

## Software Life Cycle Processes

### 1. Planning Process
- Software Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC)
- Software Development Plan (SDP)
- Software Verification Plan (SVP)
- Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP)
- Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP)

### 2. Development Process
- **Requirements**: High-level and low-level requirements
- **Design**: Software architecture
- **Coding**: Source code development
- **Integration**: Component integration

### 3. Verification Process
- **Reviews**: Requirements, design, code
- **Analysis**: Coverage, traceability
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, system

### 4. Configuration Management
- Configuration identification
- Baselines and traceability
- Problem reporting
- Change control
- Archive and retrieval

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Process monitoring
- Conformity review
- Records management

### 6. Certification Liaison
- Certification plan
- Communication with authority
- Accomplishment summary

## DAL-A Objectives (AQUA-OS)

### Requirements Coverage
- ✅ High-level requirements reviewed
- ✅ Low-level requirements reviewed
- ✅ Requirements traceable to design
- ✅ Requirements traceable to test

### Design Coverage
- ✅ Software architecture reviewed
- ✅ Design traceable to requirements
- ✅ Design traceable to code

### Code Coverage
- ✅ Source code reviewed
- ✅ Source code complies with standards
- ✅ Source code traceable to requirements
- ✅ Executable object code verified

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ Requirements-based testing
- ✅ Statement coverage: 100%
- ✅ Decision coverage: 100%
- ✅ MC/DC coverage: 98.7%
- ✅ Robustness testing completed

## Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC)

MC/DC requires that each condition in a decision independently affects the outcome:

```c
// Example: MC/DC test cases
if ((A || B) && C) {
    // Test cases needed:
    // T F T → True (A determines outcome)
    // F T T → True (B determines outcome)
    // T T F → False (C determines outcome)
    // ...
}
```

## Tool Qualification (DO-330)

Development tools must be qualified if:
1. Tool output is part of airborne software (TQL-1)
2. Tool automates verification (TQL-1)
3. Tool contributes to elimination of errors (TQL-2-5)

See [DO-330 Tool Qualification](../compliance/DO-330_evidence/tool_qualification_report.md)

## Supplements

- **DO-178C/ED-12C**: Base standard
- **DO-330/ED-215**: Software Tool Qualification
- **DO-331/ED-218**: Model-Based Development
- **DO-332/ED-217**: Object-Oriented Technology
- **DO-333/ED-216**: Formal Methods

## Compliance for BWB-Q100

### AQUA-OS Kernel (DAL-A)

**Development**:
- ✅ Requirements: 450 verified
- ✅ Design: Architecture reviewed
- ✅ Code: 15,000 SLOC reviewed
- ✅ Standards: Coding standards enforced

**Verification**:
- ✅ Test Cases: 280 executed
- ✅ Statement Coverage: 100%
- ✅ Decision Coverage: 100%
- ✅ MC/DC Coverage: 98.7%

**Evidence**:
- [Objectives Matrix](../compliance/DO-178C_evidence/objectives_matrix.md)
- [Verification Report](../compliance/DO-178C_evidence/verification_report.md)
- [Test Results](../testing/test_results/)

## Best Practices

1. **Early Verification**: Start verification activities early
2. **Traceability**: Maintain complete traceability
3. **Independence**: Verification independent of development
4. **Configuration Management**: Rigorous CM from day one
5. **Tool Qualification**: Qualify tools before use
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive and current

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Ignoring derived requirements**: Must be provided to system
❌ **Insufficient traceability**: Must trace all artifacts
❌ **Late verification**: Start verification with development
❌ **Inadequate coverage**: Must meet DAL-specific coverage
❌ **Poor tool qualification**: Tools must be qualified properly
