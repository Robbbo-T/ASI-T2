# DO-330 Tool Qualification Report

## Executive Summary
This report documents the tool qualification activities performed in accordance with DO-330 "Software Tool Qualification Considerations" for tools used in the development and verification of the BWB-Q100 AFDX implementation.

## Tool Qualification Overview
DO-330 provides guidance for qualifying software tools used in the development and verification of airborne software and airborne electronic hardware. Tools are qualified based on their potential impact on the safety of the system.

## Tool Classification

### Tool Operational Requirements (TOR)
Tools are classified based on their potential to insert or fail to detect errors:

| Tool Category | Error Detection | Error Insertion | Qualification Criteria |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| TQL-1 | Can fail to detect | - | Verification tool qualification |
| TQL-2 | - | Can insert | Development tool qualification |
| TQL-3 | Can fail to detect | Can insert | Both criteria apply |
| TQL-4 | - | Cannot insert | Criteria 3 reduced rigor |
| TQL-5 | Cannot fail to detect | - | No qualification required |

## Qualified Tools
