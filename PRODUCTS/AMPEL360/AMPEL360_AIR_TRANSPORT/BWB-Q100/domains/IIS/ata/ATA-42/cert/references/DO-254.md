# DO-254 / ED-80 - Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware

## Overview

DO-254 provides guidance for design assurance of airborne electronic hardware, including complex custom microcircuits, FPGAs, ASICs, and PLDs.

## Key Processes

- Requirements Capture
- Conceptual Design
- Detailed Design
- Implementation
- Production Transition
- Validation and Verification

## Hardware Design Assurance Levels

Aligned with software DALs (A through E), based on failure condition severity.

## BWB-Q100 Application

Hardware components including AFDX switches, ARINC-429 interfaces, and partition health monitors are developed to DAL A requirements.
