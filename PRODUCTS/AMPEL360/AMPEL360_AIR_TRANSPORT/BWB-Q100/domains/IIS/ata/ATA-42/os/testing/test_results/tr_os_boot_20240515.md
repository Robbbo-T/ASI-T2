# OS Boot Sequence Test Report

## Test Objective
Verify the IMA OS completes the boot sequence within specified time parameters and initializes all critical services.

## Test Environment
- **Hardware**: CPIOM Test Bench v2.1
- **OS Version**: AQUA-OS v3.2.1
- **Test Tools**: Internal Test Suite v1.5

## Test Procedure
1. Power on CPIOM test bench
2. Monitor boot sequence via serial console
3. Record timestamps for key boot events
4. Verify critical service initialization
5. Check for error conditions

## Test Results

### Boot Timeline
| Event | Timestamp (ms) | Specification (ms) | Status |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Power On | 0 | 0 | Pass |
| BIOS Complete | 1,250 | ≤ 1,500 | Pass |
| OS Loader Start | 1,300 | ≤ 1,600 | Pass |
| Kernel Init | 2,800 | ≤ 3,000 | Pass |
| Service Start | 4,200 | ≤ 4,500 | Pass |
| Boot Complete | 4,850 | ≤ 5,000 | Pass |

### Service Initialization
| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ARINC 653 Partitioning | ✅ Pass | All partitions active |
| Health Monitor | ✅ Pass | No faults detected |
| Network Stack | ✅ Pass | AFDX interfaces up |
| Security Services | ✅ Pass | Key management ready |
| Time Services | ✅ Pass | PTP synchronized |

## Issues Identified
1. **Minor**: Warning message during network initialization (non-blocking)
   - Resolution: Documented as known issue, no impact on safety

## Conclusion
✅ **TEST PASSED**

All boot events completed within specified time parameters. All critical services initialized successfully. One minor non-blocking issue documented.
