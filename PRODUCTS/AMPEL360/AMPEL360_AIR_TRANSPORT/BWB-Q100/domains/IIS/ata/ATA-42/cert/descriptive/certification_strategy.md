# BWB-Q100 IMA Certification Strategy

## Strategic Objectives

1. Achieve dual FAA/EASA certification
2. Demonstrate safety and security of IMA architecture
3. Establish clear supplier/integrator responsibilities
4. Minimize certification schedule and cost

## Technical Approach

### Safety-First Design
- Implement robust partitioning (spatial and temporal)
- Apply conservative design margins
- Conduct comprehensive hazard analysis

### Security by Design
- Integrate security from initial design phase
- Apply defense-in-depth principles
- Conduct threat modeling and mitigation

### Evidence-Based Certification
- Systematic evidence generation
- Traceability from requirements to verification
- Configuration control throughout lifecycle

## Authority Engagement

### Stage of Involvement (SOI) Meetings
- SOI-1: Certification Plan Review
- SOI-2: Design Review
- SOI-3: Test Plan Review
- SOI-4: Final Evidence Review

### Means of Compliance
- Analysis, testing, inspection, and similarity
- Previous certification credit where applicable
- Novel means for novel systems

## Risk Management

- Early identification of certification risks
- Mitigation plans for high-risk areas
- Regular risk review and updates

## Schedule Management

- Phased evidence generation
- Parallel development and verification
- Regular progress tracking against milestones
