# DO-178C / ED-12C - Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification

## Overview

DO-178C is the primary standard for developing and certifying airborne software. It provides guidance for producing software that performs its intended function with a level of confidence in safety that complies with airworthiness requirements.

## Key Objectives

- Software Planning Process
- Software Development Process
- Software Verification Process
- Software Configuration Management Process
- Software Quality Assurance Process

## Design Assurance Levels (DAL)

- **Level A**: Catastrophic failure conditions
- **Level B**: Hazardous failure conditions
- **Level C**: Major failure conditions
- **Level D**: Minor failure conditions
- **Level E**: No effect on safety

## BWB-Q100 Application

The BWB-Q100 IMA system software is developed to DAL A requirements due to its critical role in flight control and system management.
