# MS-20-30-0001: Material Spec — TPS Tile Handling & Inspection

## 1) Purpose & Scope

This Material Specification (MS) defines the handling, storage, inspection, and traceability requirements for Thermal Protection System (TPS) tiles used in the BWB-Q100 airframe, including:

- Receiving inspection and acceptance criteria
- Storage and environmental controls
- Handling procedures to prevent damage
- Pre-installation inspection requirements
- Traceability and configuration control

## 2) Material Specifications

### 2.1 TPS Tile Types
- **HRSI Tiles:** High-temperature reusable surface insulation
- **FRSI Tiles:** Felt reusable surface insulation  
- **AFRSI Tiles:** Advanced flexible reusable surface insulation
- **Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC):** Leading edge protection

### 2.2 Acceptance Criteria
- Dimensional tolerances: ±0.020" (±0.5 mm)
- Surface finish: Ra ≤ 250 µin (6.3 µm)
- Density: Per material specification ±5%
- Moisture content: ≤0.5% by weight

## 3) Receiving & Inspection

### 3.1 Incoming Inspection
1. **Documentation:** Verify certifications and traceability
2. **Visual inspection:** Check for cracks, chips, contamination
3. **Dimensional:** Critical dimensions per drawing
4. **Weight:** Verify within specification limits
5. **Surface quality:** Coating integrity and finish

### 3.2 Non-Conforming Material
- Quarantine immediately upon identification
- Document with non-conformance report
- Evaluate for repair, rework, or rejection
- MRB disposition for flight-critical tiles

## 4) Storage Requirements

### 4.1 Environmental Controls
- **Temperature:** 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- **Humidity:** 30-50% RH, monitored continuously
- **Contamination:** Clean room Class 100,000 minimum
- **Support:** Custom fixtures to prevent damage

### 4.2 Storage Procedures
- Individual protective packaging
- Orientation control (marked surfaces up)
- Segregation by tile type and lot
- FIFO inventory rotation system

## 5) Handling Procedures

### 5.1 Personnel Requirements
- ESD training and certification
- Clean room protocols
- Handling technique qualification
- Regular refresher training

### 5.2 Handling Equipment
- ESD-safe containers and fixtures
- Soft-jaw clamps and supports
- Contamination control supplies
- Dedicated transport dollies

### 5.3 Damage Prevention
- No contact with coated surfaces
- Support at designated lift points only
- Maximum handling force limits
- Immediate damage reporting

## 6) Pre-Installation Inspection

### 6.1 Final Quality Check
- Repeat dimensional verification
- Surface condition assessment
- Coating integrity verification
- Moisture content confirmation
- Fit-check with installation tooling

### 6.2 Installation Readiness
- Kitting with installation hardware
- Work order linkage and traceability
- Environmental conditioning if required
- Final approval stamp from QA

## 7) Traceability & Records

### 7.1 Required Documentation
- Material certifications and test data
- Receiving inspection records
- Storage condition logs
- Handling and damage records
- Pre-installation inspection results

### 7.2 Traceability System
- Unique serial number for each tile
- Barcode/QR code tracking system
- Installation location records
- Service history documentation

## 8) Quality Forms

Required documentation:
- `FORM-QA-20-30-01`: TPS Tile Receiving Inspection
- `FORM-QA-20-30-02`: Storage Condition Log
- `FORM-QA-20-30-03`: Pre-Installation Inspection
- Material certification packages
- Non-conformance reports as applicable

## 9) Routing & Data Integration

This material specification integrates with:
- **Supply chain:** Procurement and receiving systems
- **Manufacturing:** Installation procedures and work orders
- **QA:** Inspection databases and traceability systems
- **Configuration management:** Serial number tracking and history

All evidence flows through PDM-PLM for baseline control and QS certification.
