# System Design Document: EM Actuation System

## 1. Purpose & Scope
Defines architecture, interfaces and performance requirements for the electromechanical (EM) actuation of the landing gear (extension/retraction & locking).

## 2. Architecture Overview
- Actuation topology (motor, gearbox, ballscrew)
- Redundancy & fail-safe logic
- Power & thermal management
- Control interfaces (LCC/ATA-27, IIS/ATA-46)

## 3. Interfaces
- Mechanical: attachment points, loads, tolerances
- Electrical: power, signal, harnessing (EEE/ATA-24/42)
- Data: bus protocol, health/status

## 4. Performance Requirements
- Deployment time, max torque, stall margin
- Temperature/altitude envelope (vacuum to runway conditions)
- Reliability and maintainability targets
