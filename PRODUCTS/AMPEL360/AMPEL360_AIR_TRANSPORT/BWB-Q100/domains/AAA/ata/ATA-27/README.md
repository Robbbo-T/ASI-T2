- Flight control actuation and power systems
- Fly-by-wire control laws and software specifications

## BWB-Q100 Flight Control Configuration

- **Elevon control** - Combined elevator and aileron function for BWB configuration
- **Directional control** - Vertical surfaces and differential thrust for yaw control
- **Stability augmentation** - Active stability and control augmentation systems
- **Fly-by-wire systems** - Digital flight control computers and control law implementation

## Documentation Structure

Technical documentation follows ATA-27 chapter organization:

- System description and operational principles
- Installation and rigging procedures
- Maintenance and troubleshooting procedures
- Parts catalogs and service bulletins

## Integration
