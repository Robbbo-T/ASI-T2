# Structural Tests

This directory contains references to all structural test articles, test plans, and test results for wing primary structure validation.

## Purpose

References and indexes:
- Structural test plans and procedures
- Test article configurations
- Test results and reports
- Analysis correlation

## Contents

- **index.md** — Master index of structural tests with references to detailed reports

## Test Levels

### Element Tests
- Joints — Representative joint configurations
- Panels — Skin-stringer panels (buckling, compression)
- Sub-Components — Spar segments, rib sections

### Subcomponent Tests
- Wing Sections — Representative wing sections (1-2 bays)
- Attachment Fittings — Wing-to-fuselage interfaces
- Load Introduction — Actuator hard-points, hinge fittings

### Component Tests
- Wing Box — Full-scale or large-scale wing box
- Control Surface Interfaces — Wing-to-control surface attachments

### Full-Scale Tests
- Static Test — Ultimate load demonstration
- Fatigue Test — Design service goal (DSG) life
- Damage Tolerance — Residual strength with damage

## Test Objectives

### Static Ultimate Tests
- Demonstrate ultimate load capability
- Validate analysis methods and margins
- Identify failure modes and load paths
- Verify strain distributions

### Fatigue Tests
- Demonstrate DSG life without critical damage
- Validate fatigue analysis and crack growth
- Establish inspection intervals
- Verify structural health monitoring

### Damage Tolerance Tests
- Demonstrate residual strength with damage
- Validate damage growth predictions
- Establish damage limits

## Test Instrumentation

- Strain Gauges — Surface strains, load paths
- LVDTs — Displacements, deflections
- Load Cells — Applied loads verification
- DIC — Full-field strain mapping
- Acoustic Emission — Damage monitoring

## References

Detailed test data maintained in:
- `../../../cax/testing/structural/` — Test plans, reports, data

## Traceability

Each structural test includes:
- Test plan (objectives, article, loads, instrumentation)
- Test procedure (step-by-step instructions)
- As-built documentation (drawings, manufacturing, NDT)
- Test execution log
- Test report (results, correlation, conclusions)
