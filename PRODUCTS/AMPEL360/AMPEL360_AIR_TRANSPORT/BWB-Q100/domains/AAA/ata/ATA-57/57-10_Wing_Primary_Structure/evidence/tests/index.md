**Path:** `PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/AMPEL360_AIR_TRANSPORT/BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/ata/ATA-57/57-10_Wing_Primary_Structure/evidence/tests/`

## Purpose

This index references all structural test articles, test plans, and test results for wing primary structure validation.

## Test Levels

### Element Tests
- **Joints:** Representative joint configurations
- **Panels:** Skin-stringer panels for buckling, compression
- **Sub-Components:** Spar segments, rib sections

### Subcomponent Tests
- **Wing Sections:** Representative wing sections (1-2 bays)
- **Attachment Fittings:** Wing-to-fuselage interface fittings
- **Load Introduction:** Actuator hard-points, hinge fittings

### Component Tests
- **Wing Box:** Full-scale or large-scale wing box
- **Control Surface Interfaces:** Wing-to-control surface attachments

### Full-Scale Tests
- **Static Test:** Ultimate load demonstration
- **Fatigue Test:** Design service goal (DSG) life demonstration
- **Damage Tolerance:** Residual strength with damage

## Test Matrix

| Test ID | Description | Article Type | Load Type | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| ST-57-10-001 | Skin-stringer panel compression | Element | Static ultimate | Complete |
| ST-57-10-002 | Spar-to-rib joint | Element | Static ultimate | Complete |
| ST-57-10-003 | Wing-to-fuselage fitting | Subcomponent | Static ultimate | Planned |
| ST-57-10-004 | Wing box section | Subcomponent | Static ultimate | In-work |
| ST-57-10-005 | Full wing static test | Full-scale | Static ultimate | Planned |
| ST-57-10-006 | Full wing fatigue test | Full-scale | Fatigue (2 lifetimes) | Planned |

## Test Objectives

### Static Ultimate Tests
- Demonstrate ultimate load capability without failure
- Validate analysis methods and margins
- Identify failure modes and load paths
- Verify strain distributions and load sharing

### Fatigue Tests
- Demonstrate design service goal (DSG) life without critical damage
- Validate fatigue analysis and crack growth predictions
- Establish inspection intervals
- Verify structural health monitoring systems

### Damage Tolerance Tests
- Demonstrate residual strength with initial damage
- Validate damage growth predictions
- Establish damage limits for continued safe flight

## Test Instrumentation

- **Strain Gauges:** Surface strains, load paths
- **LVDTs:** Displacements, deflections
- **Load Cells:** Applied loads verification
- **DIC (Digital Image Correlation):** Full-field strain mapping
- **Acoustic Emission:** Damage initiation and growth monitoring

## Test Reports

Each test requires:
1. Test plan (objectives, article, loads, instrumentation)
2. Test procedure (step-by-step instructions)
3. As-built documentation (drawings, manufacturing records, NDT)
4. Test execution log (loads applied, observations)
5. Test report (results, analysis correlation, conclusions)

## References

Test plans and reports are maintained in:
- `../../../cax/testing/structural/` (test plans, reports, data)
- Project test program (master test schedule)

## Traceability

Each structural test must be traceable to:
1. Certification requirements (CS-25, Part 25)
2. Analysis predictions (pre-test analysis)
3. Test article configuration (as-built)
4. Non-conformances and dispositions (MRB)
5. Post-test analysis (correlation)

## Approval

Test plans require:
- Test Engineer signature
- Stress analysis correlation
- Chief Structures Engineer approval
- Certification authority notification (if required)

Test reports require:
- Test Engineer signature
- Independent review
- Chief Structures Engineer approval
- DER acceptance (if applicable)

*Structural tests are the ultimate validation of design and analysis and require rigorous planning and execution.*
