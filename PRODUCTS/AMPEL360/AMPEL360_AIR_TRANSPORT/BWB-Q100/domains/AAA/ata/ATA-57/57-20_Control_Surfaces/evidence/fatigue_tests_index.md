# Fatigue Tests Evidence

Control surface fatigue life tests and analyses; effectivity & options documented.

## Fatigue Test Types

Document references to:
- Full-scale control surface fatigue tests
- Component fatigue tests (hinges, fittings, attachments)
- Fatigue spectrum definitions
- Crack growth monitoring
- Test-to-failure results
- Fatigue life predictions and analysis

## Test Conditions

Fatigue testing parameters:
- Load spectra (flight profiles, maneuvers)
- Test duration and cycles
- Environmental conditions
- Inspection intervals
- Damage tolerance assessment

## Evidence References

All evidence files are stored externally with references here including:
- Test setup and instrumentation
- Load profiles and sequences
- Strain gauge data
- NDT inspection results
- Test reports and analysis
- Effectivity information
- QS/UTCS anchors
