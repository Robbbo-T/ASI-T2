# Loads Index

## Overview
This index tracks structural loads for ATA-57-10 wing primary structure.

## Load Cases
- Limit loads (1.0g to limit load factor)
- Ultimate loads (1.5Ã— limit)
- Fatigue spectra
- Ground loads (taxi, landing, towing)
- Gust loads
- Pressurization differential

## Load Sources
- Global FEM analysis
- Local detail analysis
- Flight loads survey
- Ground test validation

## Documentation
- Load books
- FEM reports
- Test reports
- Certification basis

## Change Control
All loads updates require structural analysis and certification engineering approval.
