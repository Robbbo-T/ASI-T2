# ICD-57-10-53: Fuselage Attachments Interface

**Interface Control Document**

## Overview
This ICD defines the interface between ATA-57-10 (Wing Primary Structure) and ATA-53 (Fuselage/Centerbody).

## Scope
- Wing-to-fuselage attachment fittings
- Load transfer mechanisms
- Tolerance specifications
- Bolt patterns and fastener requirements

## Interface Points
1. Forward wing root attachment
2. Aft wing root attachment
3. Center section carry-through

## Requirements
- **Load Transfer**: Ultimate loads per structural analysis
- **Tolerances**: Per drawing specifications
- **Materials**: Compatible with both wing and fuselage structure
- **Inspection**: NDT requirements per ATA-20 forms

## References
- ATA-53 Fuselage Structure
- ATA-20-10 Structural Practices
- Drawing: [TBD]

## Change Control
Changes to this interface require approval from both wing and fuselage structural teams and MRB.
