# NDT (Non-Destructive Testing)

This directory contains references to Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) procedures, plans, and results for wing primary structure.

## Purpose

References and indexes:
- NDT inspection procedures
- Acceptance criteria
- Inspection results and records
- Non-conformance reports

## Contents

- **index.md** — Master index of NDT plans and results with references to detailed reports

## NDT Methods

### Ultrasonic Testing (UT)
- Pulse-Echo — Through-thickness inspection
- Through-Transmission — Large area bondline integrity
- Phased Array — Advanced imaging for complex geometries

### Thermography
- Flash Thermography — Rapid subsurface defect detection
- Lock-In Thermography — Quantitative depth profiling

### Tap Testing
- Coin Tap — Manual delamination inspection
- Automated Tap — Quantitative impedance measurements

### Radiography
- X-Ray — Metallic fittings, fastener verification
- Computed Tomography (CT) — 3D imaging of critical joints

### Other Methods
- Visual Inspection — Surface defects, fiber breakout
- Bond Tester — Electrical bond resistance
- Eddy Current — Metallic crack detection

## Inspection Requirements

### Manufacturing Acceptance
- 100% UT for all bonded joints
- Flash thermography for skin panels
- X-ray for critical fastener installations
- Bond resistance for all electrical bonding points

### In-Service Inspection
- Periodic UT for bonded joints
- Tap test for accessible areas
- Eddy current for metallic fittings

## Acceptance Criteria

Standard acceptance limits:
- UT voids: ≤ 1 mm² individual, < 5% cumulative (laminate)
- UT bondline voids: ≤ 1 mm² individual, < 0.5% cumulative
- Bond resistance: Per location class requirements
- X-ray: Full fastener grip engagement required

## References

- S1000D/DMC/PR/ — NDT procedures
- Manufacturing records — As-built documentation

## Traceability

Each NDT activity includes:
- Approved procedure (Level II/III certified)
- Calibrated equipment
- Certified inspector
- Inspection report with accept/reject disposition
- Non-conformance report (if rejected)
