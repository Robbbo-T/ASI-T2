# ATA-57-90 — Repairs & Alterations

This subchapter covers repair philosophy, allowable damage limits, repair procedures, and structural alterations for wing components.

## Contents

### S1000D/
S1000D data modules containing:
- Structural repair manual (SRM) data modules
- Damage tolerance procedures
- Repair scheme libraries
- Alteration procedures
- Inspection procedures after repair

### compliance/
- Repair substantiation reports
- Damage tolerance analysis
- Alteration impact assessments
- Regulatory approval documentation (e.g., STC, field approval)

### icd/
Interface requirements for:
- Repair materials and specifications
- NDT methods for damage detection
- Engineering disposition process
- Return-to-service criteria

### evidence/
- Repair test results
- Damage assessment records
- Repair implementation records
- Post-repair inspection results
- Load testing after major repairs
- Engineering approval documentation

## Scope

Includes:
- Allowable damage limits
- Repair schemes for various damage types
- Material and process specifications for repairs
- Composite patch repair procedures
- Metallic doubler repair procedures
- Fastener hole repair methods
- Bonded scarf repairs
- Temporary vs. permanent repair criteria
- Alteration design and approval process

## Damage Categories

- **Category 1:** Cosmetic damage, no repair required
- **Category 2:** Minor damage, field-repairable per SRM
- **Category 3:** Major damage, engineering disposition required
- **Category 4:** Damage beyond economical repair

## Key ATA-20 Forms

- **FORM-QA-20-10-01** — Composite Fastening (for all fastened repairs)
- **FORM-QA-20-10-02** — Adhesive Bonding (for all bonded repairs)
- **FORM-QA-20-30-01** — Material Handling & OOC Log (for repair materials)
- **FORM-QA-20-40-01** — Bonding / EMI Continuity (for electrical bond restoration)

## Approval Process

All repairs and alterations require:
- Engineering assessment and approval
- MRB disposition for non-standard repairs
- Quality inspection and sign-off
- Documentation in aircraft records
- Regulatory approval for major alterations

## Philosophy

Repairs must:
- Restore structural capability to original or better
- Be compatible with original materials and processes
- Include provisions for inspection
- Not create new stress concentrations
- Be documented with full traceability
