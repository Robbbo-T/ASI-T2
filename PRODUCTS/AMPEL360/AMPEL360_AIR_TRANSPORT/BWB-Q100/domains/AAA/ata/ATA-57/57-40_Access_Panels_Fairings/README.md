# ATA-57-40 — Access Panels & Fairings

This subchapter covers non-structural covers, access panels, fairings, and their attachment systems on the wing.

## Contents

### S1000D/
S1000D data modules for access panel designs, fairing specifications, attachment hardware, and maintenance access procedures.

### compliance/
Structural substantiation for panel loads, aerodynamic validation, and fastener qualification.

### icd/
Interface definitions for panel dimensions, attachment patterns, sealing requirements, and maintenance access.

### evidence/
- Panel load tests
- Fastener retention tests
- Sealing effectiveness verification
- Aerodynamic smoothness measurements
- Attachment hardware qualification

## Scope

Includes:
- Access panels for wing inspection
- Removable covers for systems access
- Aerodynamic fairings
- Panel attachment hardware (dzus fasteners, quick-release mechanisms)
- Panel seals and gaskets
- Attachment edge treatments

Excludes:
- Primary structural covers that carry flight loads
- Control surface fairings (see ATA-57-20)

## Key ATA-20 Forms

- **FORM-QA-20-10-01** — Composite Fastening (for permanent attachments)
- **FORM-QA-20-20-01** — Cabin Integrity / Leak Test (for pressurized areas)

## Design Requirements

All panels and fairings must:
- Provide adequate access for inspection and maintenance
- Meet aerodynamic smoothness requirements
- Include proper sealing for environmental protection
- Be removable and reinstallable without damage
- Include clear identification and orientation markings
