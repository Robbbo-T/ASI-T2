# ICD — ATA-57-20 ↔ ATA-57-30 (High-Lift Devices)

Gap management, seal interfaces, motion envelopes, and edge interactions.

## Interface Scope

This ICD defines the interfaces between:
- **ATA-57-20**: Control surfaces (elevons, flaperons, spoilers)
- **ATA-57-30**: High-lift devices (flaps, slats, leading edge devices)

## Aerodynamic Interfaces

### Gap Management
- Gap dimensions between control surfaces and high-lift devices
- Gap variation during deployment/retraction
- Gap sealing requirements
- Aerodynamic effects of gaps

### Motion Envelopes
- Kinematic clearances during operation
- Deployment/retraction sequences
- Interference prevention
- Simultaneous motion constraints

### Edge Interactions
- Trailing edge interactions (flaperons/flaps)
- Spanwise gap control
- Surface continuity requirements
- Flow management provisions

## Structural Interfaces

### Seal Provisions
- Seal types and materials
- Attachment methods
- Wear provisions and maintenance
- Sealing effectiveness requirements

### Clearance Requirements
- Minimum clearances (all conditions)
- Contact prevention mechanisms
- Wear monitoring provisions
- Adjustment provisions

## Operational Considerations

### Combined Deflections
- Control surface deflection with flaps deployed
- Load redistribution during combined operations
- Actuation system coordination
- Flutter considerations with flaps deployed

### Maintenance Access
- Access for seal inspection/replacement
- Adjustment provisions
- Rigging requirements
- Inspection intervals

## Validation & Acceptance

### Interface Tests
- Gap measurements (all configurations)
- Clearance verification
- Seal effectiveness tests
- Combined motion tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- Gap uniformity: ±0.2 mm
- Minimum clearance: 5 mm (all conditions)
- Seal integrity: no visible gaps
- Surface continuity: within tolerance
