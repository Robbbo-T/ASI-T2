# ATA-57-20 — Control Surfaces

This subchapter covers the structural aspects of wing control surfaces including elevons, flaperons, and spoilers.

## Contents

### S1000D/
S1000D data modules for control surface structure, hinges, actuator attachments, and maintenance procedures.

### compliance/
Structural substantiation for control surface loads, flutter analysis, and certification compliance.

### icd/
Interface definitions with flight control systems (ATA-27), hydraulics (ATA-29), and actuation systems.

### evidence/
- Control surface structural tests
- Hinge moment measurements
- Fatigue test results
- Actuator attachment load tests
- Surface finish and aerodynamic verification

## Scope

Includes:
- Elevon structure and hinges
- Flaperon structure and mechanisms
- Spoiler panels and deployment mechanisms
- Control surface ribs and skins
- Hinge fittings and bearings
- Actuator attachment provisions

Excludes:
- Functional control system behavior (see ATA-27)
- Hydraulic/electric actuation systems (see ATA-29/24)

## Key ATA-20 Forms

- **FORM-QA-20-10-01** — Composite Fastening
- **FORM-QA-20-10-02** — Adhesive Bonding
