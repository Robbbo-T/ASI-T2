# Stress Analysis

This directory contains references to all stress analysis reports and substantiation documents for wing primary structure.

## Purpose

Catalogs and references:
- Static strength analyses
- Fatigue and damage tolerance analyses
- Stability analyses (buckling, crippling, post-buckling)
- Special condition analyses (lightning, FOD, environmental)

## Contents

- **index.md** — Master index of stress reports with references to detailed FEA results

## Analysis Categories

### Static Strength
- Ultimate strength demonstration
- Limit strength (no yielding)
- Margin of safety calculations

### Fatigue & Damage Tolerance
- Safe-life analyses
- Fail-safe/residual strength
- Crack growth and inspection intervals

### Stability
- Panel buckling (skin between stiffeners)
- Column buckling (stringers, spar caps)
- Local crippling
- Post-buckling behavior

### Special Conditions
- Lightning strike effects
- Foreign object damage
- Environmental effects (temperature, moisture, aging)

## FEA Models

- Global wing models (loads distribution)
- Detailed panel models (local stress concentrations)
- Joint models (bearing, fastener analysis)
- Fitting models (non-linear contact)

## References

Detailed stress analyses maintained in:
- `../../../cax/FEA/stress/wingbox/` — FEA models and results
- Formal stress analysis reports

## Traceability

All stress analyses demonstrate compliance with:
- CS-25 / Part 25 airworthiness requirements
- Company design standards
- Material allowables (see compliance/allowables/)
- Applied loads (see compliance/loads/)
