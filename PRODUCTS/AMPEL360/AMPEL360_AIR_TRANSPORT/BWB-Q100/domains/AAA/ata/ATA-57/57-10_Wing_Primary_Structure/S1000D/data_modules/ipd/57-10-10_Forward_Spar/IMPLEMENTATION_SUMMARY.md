# Forward Spar IPD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation delivers Illustrated Parts Data (IPD) for the Forward Spar assembly (ATA 57-10-10) of the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 wing. It includes complete part breakdowns for inboard, mid, and outboard sections, effectivity filtering, SVG callout templates, and QSS (Quantum Sensorial Skin) provisioning.

## Data Modules and Figures

### XML Data Modules

- **DMC-BWQ1-A-57-10-10-00-00A-941A-D-EN-US.xml**: Master assembly IPD (Sheet 1), 11 parts, exploded view.
- **DMC-BWQ1-A-57-10-10-00-01A-941B-D-EN-US.xml**: Sectional IPDs (Sheet 2), 6 IPD groups (LH/RH and INB/MID/OUTB).
- **DMC-BWQ1-A-57-10-10-00-02A-941C-D-EN-US.xml**: QSS provisioning BOM (Sheet 3), 4 groups.

### SVG Callout Templates

- 8 SVG files: Main assembly, sectionals (LH/RH, INB/MID/OUTB), QSS provisioning.
- Consistent callout IDs, color coding, and metadata blocks for illustrator reference.

## ðŸ“‹ Consolidated Bill of Materials (BOM)

### Complete Parts List

*(Include the detailed BOM table from the copilot/fix branch here for reference.)*

---

## ðŸ“Š Category Summary (by DMC)

*(Include the category summary table from copilot/fix.)*

---

## Effectivity Implementation

- All XML files use formal S1000D `<applic>` blocks for effectivity filtering.
- Group-level and item-level effectivity used for hand (LH/RH), zone (INB/MID/OUTB), and option (QSS-FS).

## ðŸ”— CAx / CAM / CAV Integration

### Naming Convention Examples

- **CAD**:  
  `PRT-BWQ1-CAD5710-UPPER-CAP-LH-r001.sldprt`
- **CAM**:  
  `NC-BWQ1-CAM5710-INB-CAP-OP10-MILL-r001.nc`
- **CAV**:  
  `DMIS-BWQ1-CAV5710-INBD-DIM-IP-OP10-r001.dmis`

### Sidecar JSON Metadata

- Each CAx/CAM/CAV file should be accompanied by a JSON file with references to associated DMCs, effectivity, and UTCS hashes (see copilot/fix for structure).

---

## Integration Notes

- **Cross-references:**  
  - Sheet 1 references descriptive DM (040A).
  - Sheet 2 references descriptive DM and Sheet 1.
  - Sheet 3 references QSS descriptive DM, Sheet 1, and Sheet 2.
- **Part numbering:**  
  - Base assembly: BWQ1-57-10-10-000 (or 57-10-10-000).
  - Sectional, QSS, fastener kits, and splice kit numbers as per BOM.

## Quality Assurance

All data modules are currently marked as `<unverified/>` and require:
1. Technical review by structural engineering
2. Configuration control approval
3. QSS integration verification
4. CAx artifact validation
5. UTCS provenance anchoring

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create XML IPD data modules
2. âœ… Document BOM and category summaries
3. âœ… Define CAx/CAM/CAV naming conventions
4. â¬œ Generate CAD models for structural parts
5. â¬œ Create sidecar JSON metadata files
6. â¬œ Link to manufacturing work instructions
7. â¬œ Establish UTCS provenance chains
8. â¬œ Technical review and verification
