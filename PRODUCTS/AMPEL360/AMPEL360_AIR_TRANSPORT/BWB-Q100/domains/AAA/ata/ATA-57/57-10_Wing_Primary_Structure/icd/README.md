# Interface Control Documents (ICDs)

This directory contains Interface Control Documents that define physical, functional, and performance interfaces between wing primary structure and adjacent systems/chapters.

## Purpose

Defines and controls:
- Physical interfaces (geometry, tolerances, fastening)
- Functional interfaces (loads, clearances, sealing)
- Performance requirements (strength, stiffness, durability)
- Change control procedures

## Contents

Three interface control documents define all external interfaces:

### ICD-57-10-53_Fuselage_Attachments.md
Wing-to-fuselage/centerbody attachment interfaces:
- Fitting locations and geometry
- Load capabilities (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, bending, torque)
- Material specifications
- Sealing requirements (fuel tank boundary)
- Fastener patterns and torque

### ICD-57-10-57-20_Control_Surfaces.md
Wing-to-control surface interfaces:
- Hinge fitting locations and loads
- Actuator hard-point provisions
- Seal lands and aerodynamic continuity
- Deflection limits and clearances

### ICD-57-10-57-50_Systems_Provisions.md
Wing structural provisions for systems:
- Hydraulic system routing and mounting
- Electrical system routing and bonding
- Fuel system provisions
- Environmental control provisions
- Lightning strike protection

## Interface Control Process

Each ICD includes:
- Responsible organizations
- Change control procedures
- Coordination mechanisms
- Issue tracking
- Acceptance criteria

## Change Management

All interface changes require:
- Joint review by affected parties
- Impact assessment
- Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) for form/fit/function changes
- Updated revision with approval signatures
