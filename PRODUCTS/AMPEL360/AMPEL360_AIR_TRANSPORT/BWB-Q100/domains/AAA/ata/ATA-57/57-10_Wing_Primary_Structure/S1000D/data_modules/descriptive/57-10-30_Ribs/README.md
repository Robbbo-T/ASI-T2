# Ribs - Descriptive Data Modules

This directory contains descriptive data modules (040A) for the rib structure of the BWB-Q100 wing.

## Scope

Ribs are transverse structural members that maintain wing section shape, distribute loads between spars and skin, and provide boundaries for fuel tanks and systems installations.

## Data Modules

### DMC-BWQ1-A-57-10-30-00-00A-040A-D-EN-US.xml
**Ribs - General Description, Numbering System, Load Distribution**
- Rib classification and types
- Numbering system and station locations
- Load distribution and structural function
- Material specifications

### DMC-BWQ1-A-57-10-30-01-00A-040A-D-EN-US.xml
**Main Ribs LH (RIB 1-10)**
- Heavy ribs at critical locations

### DMC-BWQ1-A-57-10-30-06-00A-040A-D-EN-US.xml
**Rib Attachments/Fittings**
- Spar clips and flange connections
- Fastener patterns
- Load transfer mechanisms

## Key Features

- **Material**: Composite with metallic fittings at high-load points
- **Load Function**: Section shape maintenance, distributed load transfer
- **Critical Areas**: Spar attachment flanges, fuel tank seals, system cutouts
- **Interfaces**: Forward/rear spars (57-10-10/20), skins (57-10-40), systems provisions (57-50)

## Rib Types

- **Main Ribs**: Heavy-duty ribs at major stations (fuel tank boundaries, gear beam support)
- **Intermediate Ribs**: Standard ribs for skin support and load distribution
- **Auxiliary Ribs**: Local reinforcements, partial ribs, special installations
