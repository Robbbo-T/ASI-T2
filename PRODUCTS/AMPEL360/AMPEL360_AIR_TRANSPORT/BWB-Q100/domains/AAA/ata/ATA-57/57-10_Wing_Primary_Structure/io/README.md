# Input/Output Routing

This directory contains the UTCS/QS routing manifest that defines all data flows, sources, inputs, outputs, and traceability anchors for ATA-57-10 Wing Primary Structure.

## Purpose

Defines:
- Data sources (upstream dependencies)
- Input artifacts (consumed data)
- Output artifacts (produced data)
- QOX integration (optimization problems)
- PAX integration (deployment packages)
- Evidence traceability
- UTCS/QS anchors (quantum-safe sealing)

## Contents

- **routing.manifest.yaml** — Complete data flow definition for ATA-57-10

## Manifest Structure

### Sources
Upstream dependencies from:
- **ATA-20** — Standard practices (fastening, bonding, sealing)
- **ATA-53** — Fuselage interfaces
- **ATA-57-20** — Control surface interfaces
- **ATA-57-50** — Systems provisions
- **CAX** — Geometry and analysis (CAD, FEA)
- **QOX** — Optimization results
- **PAX** — Package artifacts

### Inputs
Consumed artifacts include:
- Wing geometry (OML, structural definitions)
- Load sets (limit, ultimate, fatigue)
- Material allowables
- Joint definitions
- Fastener sets
- Laminate stacks
- Attachment fittings

### Outputs
Produced artifacts include:
- Bill of materials (BOM)
- S1000D data modules
- Assembly procedures
- Inspection plans
- Test reports

### QOX Integration
Optimization problems:
- Fastener layout optimization (QUBO)
- Ply orientation optimization (BQM)

### PAX Integration
Deployment packages:
- On-board configuration baseline
- Off-board assembly instructions

### Evidence
Traceability links to:
- Coupon test results
- NDT inspection results
- Structural test results
- Stress analysis reports
- QA forms (ATA-20)

### UTCS/QS Anchors
Quantum-safe sealing includes:
- Canonical hash (SHA-256)
- SBOM (Software/Structure Bill of Materials)
- Digital signatures
- Timestamp
- Provenance chain

## Usage

The routing manifest is the single source of truth for:
- Data lineage and provenance
- Configuration baselines
- Traceability requirements
- Integration points with other domains

## Change Control

Manifest changes require:
- Domain architect approval
- Compute team review (CAX/QOX)
- Systems integration review (PAX)
- Configuration management approval
