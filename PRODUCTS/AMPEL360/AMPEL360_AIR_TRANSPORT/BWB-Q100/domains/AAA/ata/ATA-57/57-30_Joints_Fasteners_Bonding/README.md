# ATA-57-30 — Joints, Fasteners & Bonding

This subchapter covers structural joints, fastening systems, and adhesive bonding for wing structures.

## Contents

### S1000D/
S1000D data modules for joint designs, fastener specifications, bonding procedures, and quality standards.

### compliance/
Joint substantiation, fastener qualification, bonding process validation, and material compatibility studies.

### icd/
Interface standards for joint configurations, fastener selection criteria, and bonding requirements.

### evidence/
- Joint static and fatigue test results
- Fastener pull-out and shear tests
- Bonded joint qualification tests
- Surface preparation verification
- Torque calibration records
- Cure cycle monitoring data

## Scope

Includes:
- Mechanical joints (bolted, riveted)
- Composite-to-composite joints
- Metal-to-composite joints
- Adhesive bonding systems
- Fastener specifications and selection
- Joint sealants and corrosion protection
- Galvanic isolation provisions

## Key ATA-20 Forms

- **FORM-QA-20-10-01** — Composite Fastening (mandatory for all fastened joints)
- **FORM-QA-20-10-02** — Adhesive Bonding (mandatory for all bonded joints)
- **FORM-QA-20-40-01** — Bonding / EMI Continuity (for electrical bonding)

## Design Philosophy

All joints must:
- Provide load path redundancy where practical
- Include provisions for inspection and maintenance
- Meet fatigue life requirements
- Include corrosion protection
- Be compatible with assembly sequence
