# NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) Index

**Path:** `PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/AMPEL360_AIR_TRANSPORT/BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/ata/ATA-57/57-10_Wing_Primary_Structure/evidence/ndt/`

## Purpose

This index references all Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) procedures, plans, and results for wing primary structure.

## NDT Methods

### Ultrasonic Testing (UT)
- **Pulse-Echo:** Through-thickness inspection for voids, delaminations
- **Through-Transmission:** Large area scanning for bondline integrity
- **Phased Array:** Advanced imaging for complex geometries

### Thermography
- **Flash Thermography:** Rapid inspection for subsurface defects
- **Lock-In Thermography:** Quantitative depth profiling

### Tap Testing
- **Coin Tap:** Manual inspection for delaminations
- **Automated Tap:** Quantitative impedance measurements

### Radiography
- **X-Ray:** Metallic fittings, fastener installation verification
- **Computed Tomography (CT):** 3D imaging of critical joints

### Other Methods
- **Visual Inspection:** Surface defects, fiber breakout
- **Bond Tester:** Electrical bond resistance measurements
- **Eddy Current:** Metallic component crack detection

## Inspection Requirements

### Manufacturing Acceptance
- **100% UT:** All bonded joints, co-cured structure
- **Flash Thermography:** Skin panels for manufacturing defects
- **X-Ray:** All fastener installations in critical areas
- **Bond Resistance:** All electrical bonding points (LSP, down-bonds)

### In-Service Inspection
- **Periodic UT:** Bonded joint integrity per maintenance schedule
- **Tap Test:** Accessible areas during routine maintenance
- **Eddy Current:** Metallic fittings for fatigue cracks

## Acceptance Criteria

| Method | Feature | Acceptance | Rejection |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| UT | Voids in laminate | ≤ 1 mm² individual, < 5% cumulative | > 1 mm² or > 5% area |
| UT | Bondline voids | ≤ 1 mm² individual, < 0.5% cumulative | > 1 mm² or > 0.5% area |
| Flash Thermo | Delaminations | None | Any indication |
| X-Ray | Fastener grip | Full grip engagement | Insufficient grip |
| Bond Tester | Resistance | < 2.5 mΩ (typical) | Per location class |

## NDT Plans

| Plan ID | Title | Scope | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| NDT-57-10-001 | Wing Skins UT Inspection | All bonded skins | Approved |
| NDT-57-10-002 | Spar Cap UT Inspection | Front/rear spar caps | Approved |
| NDT-57-10-003 | Joint X-Ray Inspection | Critical fastened joints | Approved |
| NDT-57-10-004 | LSP Bond Resistance | All LSP terminations | Approved |
| NDT-57-10-005 | In-Service Inspection | Periodic maintenance | In-work |

## References

NDT procedures and results are maintained in:
- S1000D/DMC/PR/ (NDT procedures)
- Manufacturing records (as-built documentation)
- MRB records (non-conformances, dispositions)

## Traceability

Each NDT activity must have:
1. Approved procedure (level II/III certified)
2. Calibrated equipment (current calibration certificate)
3. Certified inspector (NDT Level II minimum)
4. Inspection report with accept/reject disposition
5. Non-conformance report (if rejected)

## Quality Assurance

- All NDT procedures require QA approval
- Periodic audits of NDT activities
- Inspector certification maintenance
- Equipment calibration tracking

*NDT is a critical quality gate and requires strict adherence to approved procedures.*
