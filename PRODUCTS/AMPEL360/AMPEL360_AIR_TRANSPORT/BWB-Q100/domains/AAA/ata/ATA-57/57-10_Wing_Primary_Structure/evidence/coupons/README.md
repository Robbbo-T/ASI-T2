# Coupon Tests

This directory contains references to coupon-level test results used to establish material and joint allowables for wing primary structure.

## Purpose

References and indexes:
- Material characterization coupon tests
- Joint qualification tests
- Environmental conditioning results
- Statistical analysis for allowables

## Contents

- **index.md** — Master index of coupon test results with references to detailed reports

## Test Categories

### Material Characterization
- Tension (0°, 45°, 90° fiber orientations)
- Compression (0°, 45°, 90° fiber orientations)
- Shear (in-plane, interlaminar)
- Bearing (pin bearing, bolt bearing)

### Joint Testing
- Open-Hole Tension (OHT) — Notch sensitivity
- Filled-Hole Tension (FHT) — Interference fit effects
- Bearing/Bypass — Combined loads
- Pull-Through — Fastener resistance
- Bolted Lap Joints — Single-lap, double-lap

### Bonded Joint Testing
- Lap Shear — Adhesive shear strength
- Peel — Mode I fracture toughness
- Mixed-Mode — Combined shear and peel
- Durability — Hot/wet aging, thermal cycling

### Environmental Effects
- Hot/Wet Conditioning
- Cold Temperature (-55°C)
- UV Exposure
- Chemical Exposure (fluids, deicing)

## Statistical Analysis

Test results are analyzed to establish:
- **A-Basis** — 99% probability with 95% confidence
- **B-Basis** — 90% probability with 95% confidence
- **S-Basis** — Specification minimum values

Detailed test data maintained in:
- `../../../cax/testing/coupons/` — Raw data and test reports

## Traceability

Each coupon test includes:
- Test plan and procedure
- Material certification (batch traceability)
- Environmental conditioning log
- Test data and photos
- Statistical analysis
- Approval signatures
