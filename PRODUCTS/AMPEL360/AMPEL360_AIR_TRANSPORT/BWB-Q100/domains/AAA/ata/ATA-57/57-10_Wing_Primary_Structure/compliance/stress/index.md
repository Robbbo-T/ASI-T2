# Stress Analysis Index

**Path:** `PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/AMPEL360_AIR_TRANSPORT/BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/ata/ATA-57/57-10_Wing_Primary_Structure/compliance/stress/`

## Purpose

This index references all stress analysis reports and substantiation documents for wing primary structure.

## Analysis Categories

### Static Strength
- **Ultimate Strength:** Demonstrate capability to withstand ultimate loads without failure
- **Limit Strength:** Demonstrate no yielding or permanent deformation at limit loads
- **Reserve Factors:** Minimum margins of safety (MS â‰¥ 0.0)

### Fatigue & Damage Tolerance
- **Safe-Life:** Demonstrate adequate fatigue life to design service goal
- **Fail-Safe:** Demonstrate residual strength with partial failure
- **Damage Tolerance:** Growth of initial damage, inspection intervals

### Stability
- **Panel Buckling:** Skin panels between stiffeners
- **Column Buckling:** Stringers, spar caps
- **Crippling:** Local instability of thin-walled sections
- **Post-Buckling:** Redistribution after initial buckling

### Special Conditions
- **Lightning Strike:** Direct and indirect effects on structure
- **Foreign Object Damage:** Impact resistance, residual strength
- **Environmental Effects:** Temperature, moisture, aging

## FEA Models

- **Global Wing Model:** Coarse mesh for loads distribution
- **Detailed Panel Models:** Fine mesh for local stress concentrations
- **Joint Models:** 3D solid elements for bearing and fastener analysis
- **Fitting Models:** Non-linear contact analysis

## References

Stress analysis is maintained in CAX/FEA and referenced via:
- `../../../cax/FEA/stress/wingbox/` (FEA models, results)
- Stress analysis reports (formal documentation)

## Substantiation

All stress analyses must demonstrate compliance with:
1. CS-25 / Part 25 (Airworthiness requirements)
2. Company design standards
3. Material allowables (see compliance/allowables/)
4. Applied loads (see compliance/loads/)

## Approval

Stress reports require:
- Stress Engineer signature
- Independent checker signature
- Chief Stress Engineer approval
- DER (if applicable) review and acceptance

---
*Stress reports are configuration-controlled and maintained in PDM/PLM system.*
