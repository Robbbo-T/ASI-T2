# ICD — ATA-57-20 ↔ ATA-57-10 (Wing Primary Structure)

Attachment locations, tolerances, allowable loads, fastener patterns, bonding requirements.

## Interface Scope

This ICD defines the interfaces between:
- **ATA-57-20**: Control surface structures and hinges
- **ATA-57-10**: Wing primary structure (rear spar, hinge fittings)

## Structural Interfaces

### Hinge Attachment Points
- Hinge line locations and datum references
- Attachment fitting locations on wing structure
- Fastener hole patterns and specifications
- Bolt/bushing specifications

### Load Transfer
- Ultimate load cases at hinge points
- Load distribution between multiple hinges
- Shear and moment transfer mechanisms
- Allowable bearing stresses

### Geometric Tolerances
- Position tolerances for hinge fittings
- Angular alignment tolerances
- Surface finish requirements at interfaces
- Gap control between mating parts

## Material & Process Requirements

### Fastening
- Fastener types and materials
- Hole preparation and tolerances
- Torque specifications
- Locking methods (lock wire, lock bolts, etc.)

### Bonding & Sealing
- Adhesive bonding at interfaces (if applicable)
- Sealant specifications
- Surface preparation requirements
- Cure cycles and inspection

### Corrosion Protection
- Material compatibility
- Protective coatings at interfaces
- Galvanic isolation requirements
- Drainage provisions

## Validation & Acceptance

### Interface Verification
- Fit checks and hole alignment
- Fastener installation verification
- Torque measurements
- Gap measurements

### Acceptance Criteria
- Position accuracy: ±0.5 mm
- Hole alignment: within tolerance per drawing
- Fastener torque: per specification
- Gap uniformity: ±0.2 mm

### Inspection Requirements
- Visual inspection of all interfaces
- NDT of critical fastener holes
- Seal integrity verification
- Dimensional verification
