# Allowables Index

## Overview
This index tracks material and joint allowables for ATA-57-10 wing primary structure.

## Material Allowables
- Composite material systems (e.g., IM7/8552, AS4/8552)
- Metallic materials (titanium, aluminum alloys)
- Adhesive allowables
- Temperature and moisture knockdown factors

## Joint Allowables
- Bolted joint allowables (bearing, bypass, shear-out)
- Bonded joint allowables (shear, peel)
- Hybrid joint configurations

## References
- Material specifications
- Test reports
- Statistical analysis (A-basis, B-basis, S-basis)
- MMPDS data

## Change Control
All allowables updates require M&P approval and structural analysis verification.
