# ICD-57-10-57-20: Control Surfaces Interface

**Interface Control Document**

## Overview
This ICD defines the interface between ATA-57-10 (Wing Primary Structure) and ATA-57-20 (Control Surfaces).

## Scope
- Hinge attachment hard-points
- Actuator bracket provisions
- Seal lands and gaps
- Load paths for control surface reactions

## Interface Points
1. Aileron hinge fittings
2. Spoiler hinge fittings
3. Actuator hard-points
4. Seal interface surfaces

## Requirements
- **Load Transfer**: Control surface limit/ultimate loads
- **Hinge Alignment**: Per drawing tolerances
- **Surface Finish**: Seal land requirements
- **Inspection**: Hinge bearing fit and alignment checks

## References
- ATA-57-20 Control Surfaces
- ATA-27 Flight Controls
- Drawing: [TBD]

## Change Control
Changes to this interface require approval from structural and flight controls teams and MRB.
