# Descriptive Data Modules - Wing Primary Structure

This directory contains S1000D descriptive data modules (Info Code 040A) providing technical descriptions, specifications, and design information for wing primary structure components.

## Component Organization

### 57-10-10 Forward Spar
Load-bearing spar structure including:
- Inboard, mid, and outboard sections (LH/RH)
- Upper and lower caps with composite layup details
- Web structure with stiffeners and lightening holes
- Splice joints and load transfer mechanisms

### 57-10-20 Rear Spar
Aft spar structure including:
- Inboard, mid, and outboard sections (LH/RH)
- Upper and lower caps (tension/compression loads)
- Web structure with actuator cutouts
- Landing gear beam interface
- Control surface hinge locations

### 57-10-30 Ribs
Transverse structural members including:
- Main ribs (heavy ribs at fuel tank boundaries)
- Intermediate ribs (skin panel support)
- Auxiliary ribs (local reinforcements)
- Rib attachments and fittings

### 57-10-40 Skin Panels
Wing skin panels including:
- Upper skin (inboard, mid, outboard - LH/RH)
- Lower skin (inboard, mid, outboard - LH/RH)
- Panel boundaries and thickness schedules
- Splice joints and inspection access
- Lightning protection and anti-icing provisions

### 57-10-50 Stringers
Longitudinal stiffening members including:
- Upper stringers (compression members)
- Lower stringers (tension members)
- Section properties and splices
- Spanwise arrangement

### 57-10-60 Attachments
Major structural fittings including:
- Wing-to-fuselage fittings

- Control surface hinge fittings

## Data Module Content

Each descriptive data module typically includes:
- Component identification and location
- Material specifications (composite layup, metal alloys)
- Geometry and dimensions
- Load paths and structural function
- Interface definitions
- Fastener patterns and joint details
- Special processes (bonding, sealing)
- References to applicable standards (ATA-20)

## Information Code

All modules in this directory use:
- **040A** - Descriptive information code
- Content type: **D** (Descriptive)

## Validation Requirements

Descriptive data modules must:
- Validate against S1000D 6.0 descript.xsd schema
- Comply with BREX rules (../../BREX/BREX.xml)
- Reference correct material specifications
- Link to applicable ICDs in `../../../icd/`
- Include proper effectivity expressions

## Cross-References

Descriptive modules should reference:
- **ATA-20 forms** for standard practices (fastening, bonding, sealing)
- **JSON schemas** in `../../../contracts/schemas/` for data structures
- **ICDs** for interface definitions
- **Procedural modules** for related maintenance tasks
