# ATA-57-50 — Systems Provisions & Interfaces

This subchapter covers structural provisions for systems routed through or attached to the wing structure.

## Contents

### S1000D/
S1000D data modules for systems interface requirements, structural provisions, routing constraints, and installation procedures.

### compliance/
Substantiation of cut-outs, attachments, and structural modifications for systems integration.

### icd/
Interface control documents defining:
- Electrical systems provisions (ATA-24)
- Hydraulic systems provisions (ATA-29)
- Fuel systems provisions (ATA-28)
- Flight control provisions (ATA-27)
- Environmental control provisions (ATA-21)
- De-icing provisions (ATA-30)

### evidence/
- Structural substantiation for cut-outs
- Load testing of system attachments
- Lightning bond verification
- EMI/ESD compliance tests
- Installation verification
- Routing clearance verification

## Scope

Includes:
- Structural brackets for system components
- Conduit and wire bundle routing provisions
- Hydraulic/pneumatic line routing
- Fuel tank boundaries and fittings
- Lightning strike bonds (structural)
- EMI/ESD bonding provisions
- Cut-outs and penetrations for systems
- Access provisions for system maintenance

Excludes:
- Functional system behavior (see respective ATA chapters)
- System-level requirements and performance

## Key ATA-20 Forms

- **FORM-QA-20-40-01** — Bonding / EMI Continuity (mandatory for all electrical bonds)
- **FORM-QA-20-10-01** — Composite Fastening (for system brackets)
- **FORM-QA-20-20-01** — Cabin Integrity / Leak Test (for pressurization interfaces)

## Integration Philosophy

Systems provisions must:
- Maintain structural integrity of primary structure
- Provide adequate load paths around cut-outs
- Include electrical bonding as required
- Allow for thermal expansion and vibration
- Be compatible with maintenance procedures
- Include provisions for inspection access
