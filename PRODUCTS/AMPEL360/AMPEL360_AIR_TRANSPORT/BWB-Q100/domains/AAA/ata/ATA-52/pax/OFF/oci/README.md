# OFF OCI - Packaging

This directory contains OFF (Off-Board) OCI (Open Container Initiative) specifications for BWB-Q100 AAA domain containerization.

## Purpose

Manages OCI-compliant container specifications including:

- Container runtime specifications and configurations
- Image layer definitions and optimization
- Security policies and access control specifications
- Federation-compatible container interfaces

## OCI Components

- **Runtime specs** - Container execution environment and resource constraints
- **Image specs** - Layer composition and content addressing specifications
- **Distribution specs** - Container registry and distribution protocols
- **Security specs** - Access control, signing, and verification policies

## OFF Integration

OCI specifications enable:

- Federated container deployment across distributed infrastructure
- Secure container execution with cryptographic verification
- Interoperable container runtime across different orchestration platforms
- Standardized container lifecycle management for AAA domain applications
