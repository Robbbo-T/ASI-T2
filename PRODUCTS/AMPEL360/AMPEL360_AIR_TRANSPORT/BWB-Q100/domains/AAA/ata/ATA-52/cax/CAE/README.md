# AAA/CAx/CAE — Aerodynamic & Airframe Computer-Aided Engineering

Structural analysis, finite element analysis, and safety margin verification for BWB-Q100 aerodynamic and structural components.

## Process Overview

Computer-aided engineering processes for structural validation, load path analysis, and safety margin verification of BWB wing and airframe systems.

**Primary Focus**: Wing structural analysis, fatigue evaluation, damage tolerance, and certification compliance.

## Key Activities

### Structural Analysis
