# High-Lift Systems - CAD Models

This directory contains CAD models and design data for BWB-Q100 wing high-lift systems.

## Purpose

Manages high-lift system geometry and integration including:

- Leading edge devices (slats, Krueger flaps)
- Trailing edge devices (flaps, flaperons)
- High-lift system kinematics and deployment mechanisms
- Aerodynamic gap and overlap optimization

## BWB-Q100 High-Lift Configuration

- **Leading edge systems** - Slats and leading edge devices for stall prevention
- **Trailing edge flaps** - Multi-element flap systems for maximum lift generation
- **Integration zones** - Transition areas between high-lift and fixed wing surfaces
- **Actuation systems** - Mechanical and hydraulic deployment mechanisms

## Design Integration

High-lift system models coordinate with:

- Wing baseline geometry for seamless surface continuity
- Structural layout for load transfer and support structure integration
- Control surfaces for operational interference management
- Systems integration for hydraulic, electrical, and control system routing
