# Wing Performance Validation — CFD Analysis & Validation

Computational fluid dynamics analysis and aerodynamic performance validation for BWB-Q100 wing systems.

## Analysis Overview

Comprehensive aerodynamic analysis of BWB-Q100 wing systems including cruise performance, high-lift validation, and certification compliance.

**Configuration**: BWB-Q100 Baseline (conf_000_baseline)
**Primary Application**: ATA-57 Wing Systems Performance Validation

## Analysis Scope

### Cruise Performance
- Transonic cruise aerodynamics (M0.78 @ FL390)
- Drag breakdown and optimization
- Wing-body integration effects
- Natural laminar flow validation

### High-Lift Performance
- Maximum lift coefficient validation (CLmax ≥ 2.8)
- Flap and slat effectiveness analysis
- Stall progression characteristics
- Ground effect aerodynamics

### Control Surface Analysis
- Aileron effectiveness and hinge moments
- Spoiler/speedbrake performance
- Control surface interference effects
- Load alleviation system validation

## Flow Conditions

### Design Points
- **Cruise**: M0.78, FL390, ISA conditions
- **High-Lift**: M0.25, sea level, takeoff/landing
- **Buffet**: M0.78, buffet onset + 0.3g margin
- **Stall**: Low speed, various configurations

### Environmental Conditions
- Standard atmosphere (ISA)
- Hot day conditions (ISA +15°C)
- Crosswind conditions
- Icing conditions (where applicable)

## CFD Methods

### Turbulence Modeling

### Advanced Methods
- Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for separated flows
- Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) for massively separated flows
- Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) for aeroelasticity
- Unsteady analysis for dynamic effects

### Mesh Requirements
- **Surface Mesh**: y+ < 1 for boundary layer resolution
- **Volume Mesh**: Structured/unstructured hybrid
- **Refinement**: Shock regions, wake areas, high gradients
- **Quality**: Aspect ratio, skewness, orthogonality criteria

## Performance Validation

### Aerodynamic Targets
- **Cruise L/D**: ≥ 18 for BWB-Q100 configuration
- **CLmax**: ≥ 2.8 with high-lift systems deployed
- **Buffet Margin**: ≥ 0.3g at cruise conditions
- **Stall Characteristics**: Predictable, gentle stall progression

### Integration Requirements
- Wing-fuselage pressure matching
- Control surface gap flow modeling
- Landing gear integration effects
- Engine installation effects
