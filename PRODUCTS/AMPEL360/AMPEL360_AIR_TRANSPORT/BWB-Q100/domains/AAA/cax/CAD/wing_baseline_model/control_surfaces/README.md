# Control Surfaces - CAD Models

This directory contains CAD models and design data for BWB-Q100 wing control surfaces.

## Purpose

Manages control surface geometry and design including:

- Primary control surfaces (elevons, rudders)
- Secondary control surfaces (trim tabs, spoilers)
- Control surface actuation systems integration
- Aerodynamic and structural interface definitions

## BWB-Q100 Control Surfaces

- **Elevons** - Combined elevator and aileron surfaces for BWB configuration
- **Winglets/Vertical surfaces** - Directional control and stability surfaces
- **Spoilers** - Lift reduction and drag generation surfaces
- **Trim surfaces** - Fine control and balance adjustment surfaces

## CAD Integration

Control surface models integrate with:

- Wing baseline geometry for seamless aerodynamic integration
- Structural layout for load path and attachment point definition
- High-lift systems for coordinated operation and interference management
- Flight control system interfaces for actuation and control authority requirements
