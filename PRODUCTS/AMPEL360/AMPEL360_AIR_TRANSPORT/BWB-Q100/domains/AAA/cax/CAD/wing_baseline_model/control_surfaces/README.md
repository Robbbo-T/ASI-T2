# Control Surfaces - CAD Models

This directory contains CAD models and design data for BWB-Q100 wing control surfaces.

## Purpose

Manages control surface geometry and design including:

- Primary control surfaces (elevons, rudders)
- Secondary control surfaces (trim tabs, spoilers)
- Control surface actuation systems integration
- Aerodynamic and structural interface definitions

## BWB-Q100 Control Surfaces

- **Elevons** - Combined elevator and aileron surfaces for BWB configuration (elevons.yaml)
- **Flaperons** - High-lift and control surface combination (flaperons.yaml)
- **Spoilers** - Lift reduction, drag generation, and roll assist surfaces (spoilers.yaml)
- **Vertical surfaces** - Twin winglet rudders and center vertical stabilizer (vertical_surfaces.yaml)
- **Trim surfaces** - Pitch, roll, yaw, and span load distribution trim tabs (trim_surfaces.yaml)

See index.yaml for complete control surface inventory and integration summary.

## CAD Integration

Control surface models integrate with:

- Wing baseline geometry for seamless aerodynamic integration
- Structural layout for load path and attachment point definition
- High-lift systems for coordinated operation and interference management
- Flight control system interfaces for actuation and control authority requirements
