# Structural Layout - Nastran Models

This directory contains MSC Nastran finite element models for BWB-Q100 wing structural analysis.

## Purpose

Provides structural analysis models including:

- Finite element mesh definitions for wing structure
- Material property definitions and structural configurations
- Load case definitions and boundary condition specifications
- Structural optimization and design validation models

## Nastran Model Components

- **Structural mesh** - Finite element discretization of wing primary structure
- **Material models** - Composite and metallic material property definitions
- **Load cases** - Flight loads, ground loads, and certification load scenarios
- **Boundary conditions** - Constraint definitions and interface load transfer

## Analysis Integration

Nastran models support:

- Static strength and stiffness analysis for certification compliance
- Dynamic analysis for flutter and vibration assessment
- Optimization studies for weight reduction and performance improvement
- Integration with CAD geometry for automated mesh generation and model updates
