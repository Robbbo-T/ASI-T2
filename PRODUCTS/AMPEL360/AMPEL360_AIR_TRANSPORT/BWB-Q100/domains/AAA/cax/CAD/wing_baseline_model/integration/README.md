# Integration - CAD Models

This directory contains integration models and interface definitions for BWB-Q100 wing systems.

## Purpose

Manages system integration and interface coordination including:

- Wing-fuselage integration and blending
- Systems integration and routing through wing structure
- Landing gear integration and wheel well definition
- Engine integration and propulsion system interfaces

## Integration Areas

- **Wing-body blending** - Seamless aerodynamic transition between wing and fuselage
- **Systems routing** - Hydraulic, electrical, and fuel system integration
- **Structural continuity** - Load path integration across wing-body interface
- **Maintenance access** - Service panels and inspection access integration

## Design Coordination

Integration models ensure compatibility between:

- Wing baseline geometry and overall aircraft configuration
- Structural layout and systems installation requirements
- Control surfaces and high-lift systems operational clearances
- Manufacturing and assembly process requirements for integrated wing-body construction
