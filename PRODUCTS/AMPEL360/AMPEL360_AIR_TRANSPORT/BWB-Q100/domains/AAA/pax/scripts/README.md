# PAx Scripts - Packaging

This directory contains automation scripts for BWB-Q100 AAA domain packaging and containerization processes.

## Purpose

Provides automation for:

- Container image building and optimization
- Package assembly and validation
- Deployment automation and orchestration
- Environment provisioning and configuration management

## Script Categories

- **Build scripts** - Automated container image construction and optimization
- **Validation scripts** - Package integrity checking and compliance validation
- **Deployment scripts** - Container orchestration and service deployment automation
- **Utility scripts** - Package management and maintenance automation

## Files

- **`validate_pax.py`** - PAx manifest validator with JSON schema compliance checking
  - **Version:** Enhanced with intelligent file filtering (v1.1)
  - **Features:**
    - Validates manifests against `package.schema.json`
    - Enforces UTCS/QS evidence fields and patterns
    - Verifies referenced files exist (SBOM, signatures)
    - **Excludes non-manifest files:** SBOM files (`.spdx.json`, `.cdx.json`), schema files (`.schema.json`), and files in `sbom/`, `schemas/`, `certificates/` directories
    - Emits CI-friendly output with clear error messages
  - **Usage:**
    ```bash
    # Validate specific manifest
    python validate_pax.py manifest.yaml
    
    # Scan entire PAx directory
    python validate_pax.py --schema schemas/package.schema.json --root .
    ```
