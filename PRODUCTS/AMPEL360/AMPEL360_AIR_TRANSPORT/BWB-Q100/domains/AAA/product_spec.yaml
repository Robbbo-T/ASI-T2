# Bridge Span Declarations
bridge_spans:
  - name: StructuralAnalysis
    spans: [CB, FWD]
    rationale: >
      Classical finite element analysis (CB) establishes baseline stress/strain
      distributions and load paths. Future Wave Dynamics (FWD) predicts fatigue
      life progression and damage accumulation based on flight spectra.
    tools: [Nastran, Abaqus, Fatigue_Life_Predictor]
    
  - name: LayupOptimization
    spans: [CB, QB, UE]
    rationale: >
      Baseline layup via classical laminate theory (CB). Quantum-inspired
      optimization (QB) explores ply orientations and drop-off sequences to
      minimize weight while meeting strength requirements. Unit Element (UE)
      modules standardize cap/web interfaces.
    tools: [Composite_Optimizer_QB, Laminate_Schema_Generator]
    
  - name: SensorIntegration
    spans: [UE, FE, QS]
    rationale: >
      Quantum Sensorial Skin patches are Unit Elements (UE) with standardized
      interfaces. Federation (FE) coordinates sensor data across wing structure.
      Quantum State (QS) provides immutable provenance for all sensor readings.
