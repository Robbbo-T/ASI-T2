# CCC — Cockpit, Cabin & Cargo

Human-machine interfaces, passenger cabin systems, and cargo handling for the BWB-Q100 configuration.

## Domain Overview

**Core Focus**: Flight deck design, passenger cabin layout, cargo systems, and human factors optimization for blended wing body configuration.

**Key Systems**: Placards/Markings (ATA-11), Cabin Systems (ATA-25), Indicating Systems (ATA-31), Lights (ATA-33), Navigation (ATA-38).

## Process Organization

### CAx (Computer-Aided Processes)
- **[CAD](./cax/CAD/)** — Cabin layout design, seat configuration, cargo bay geometry
- **[CAE](./cax/CAE/)** — Structural analysis of cabin and cargo systems
- **[VP](./cax/VP/)** — Virtual prototyping of cabin ergonomics and systems
- **[PDM-PLM](./cax/PDM-PLM/)** — Configuration management for interior variants

### QOx (Quantum-Optimized Processes)
- **[QAOA](./qox/qaoa/)** — Cabin layout optimization via QAOA for passenger comfort and efficiency
- **[QUBO](./qox/qubo/)** — Test plan optimization for human factors validation using QUBO formulations

### ATA Documentation
- **[ATA-11](./ata/ATA-11/)** — Placards and Markings
- **[ATA-25](./ata/ATA-25/)** — Equipment/Furnishings
- **[ATA-31](./ata/ATA-31/)** — Indicating/Recording Systems
- **[ATA-33](./ata/ATA-33/)** — Lights
- **[ATA-38](./ata/ATA-38/)** — Water/Waste

## Key Optimization Targets

### Quantum-Enhanced CAx → QOx Applications
1. **Cabin Layout Optimization**: Passenger comfort and space utilization via QAOA
2. **Cargo Loading Optimization**: Weight distribution and loading sequence optimization
3. **Emergency Egress**: Optimal evacuation route planning using quantum algorithms
4. **Interior Systems Integration**: Multi-objective optimization for weight, cost, and comfort

### Sustainability Levers (SIM Integration)
- **Material Efficiency**: Lightweight interior materials and optimized usage
- **Energy Consumption**: LED lighting and efficient cabin systems
- **Passenger Comfort**: Improved experience leading to higher load factors
- **Operational Flexibility**: Adaptable cabin configurations for different routes
