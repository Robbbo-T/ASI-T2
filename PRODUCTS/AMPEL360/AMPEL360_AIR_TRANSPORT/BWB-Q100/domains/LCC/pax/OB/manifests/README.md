# LCC PAx OB Manifests

This directory contains ARINC-653 partition manifests and health interface configurations for the BWB-Q100 QAFbW autopilot system in the LCC (Linkages, Control & Comms) domain.

## Purpose

Provides ARINC-653 compliant partition definitions and health monitoring interfaces for:

- **Real-time scheduling** - CAST-32A validated task scheduling with timing guarantees
- **Resource allocation** - Memory, CPU, and I/O resource budgeting for DAL A systems
- **Health monitoring** - KPI thresholds and FDIR mapping for BWB autopilot systems
- **Safety compliance** - TFA-aligned evidence and validation requirements

## Manifest Files

### `lcc.qafbw.partition.yaml`
**ARINC-653 Partition Configuration**

Defines the BWB-Q100 autopilot partition with:
- **Partition ID**: 22 (DAL A)
- **Major Frame**: 35ms with 5 scheduled tasks
- **Memory Budget**: 1024 KiB code, 2048 KiB data
- **Surface Allocation**: Static slots for 35 BWB control surfaces
- **Watchdog**: 100ms timeout with PTP time synchronization

Tasks:
- `SENSOR_FUSION` (5ms) - Sensor data processing and voting
- `CTRL_LAW` (10ms) - Flight control law execution
- `SURF_COORD` (6ms) - 35-surface coordination and allocation
- `MONITOR` (2ms) - Health monitoring and FDIR
- `HOUSEKEEPING` (2ms) - System maintenance and diagnostics

### `lcc.health_interface.yaml`
**Health Monitoring Interface**

Defines KPIs and FDIR mapping for:
- **Cross-axis coupling**: ≤0.15 across all flight points
- **Surface sync**: p95 skew ≤5ms between paired surfaces
- **Allocator recovery**: ≤2 cycles post-failure rebalancing
- **Coverage requirements**: MC/DC = 1.0, deadline misses = 0

## Integration

These manifests integrate with:
- **AQUA OS** partition management and resource allocation
- **QAFbW** autopilot control laws and surface coordination
- **TFA gates** through schedulability and health validation
- **CI/CD** pipeline via automated compliance checking

## Validation

Manifests are validated by:
- `scripts/validate_schedulability.py` - CAST-32A timing analysis
- `domains/LCC/pax/scripts/validate_pax.py` - Evidence and compliance
- `.github/workflows/lcc_qafbw_gate.yml` - Automated CI gates
