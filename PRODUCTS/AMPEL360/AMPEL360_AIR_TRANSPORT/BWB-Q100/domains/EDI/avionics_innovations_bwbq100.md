# Avionics Innovations for Ampel360 BWB‑Q100

## Purpose

The BWB‑Q100 blended‑wing aircraft under the AMPEL360 product line will rely on advanced avionics to meet sustainability, safety, and efficiency goals. This document summarises recent hardware and software innovations in avionics and proposes how they can be applied within the BWB‑Q100 domain of the Electronics & Digital Instruments (EDI) area. These insights inform CAI, CASE, and VP processes and bridge to regulatory ATA chapters.

## 1. Hardware innovations

### Integrated Modular Avionics and Flight Controls

**Fly‑by‑Wire (FBW) flight control systems**: JetZero selected Thales's proven fly‑by‑wire solution for its BWB demonstrator. The system provides flight‑envelope protection, reduces pilot workload, and improves handling and reliability ([runwaygirlnetwork.com](https://runwaygirlnetwork.com)). For BWB‑Q100, similar FBW architectures with triplex flight‑control computers, redundancy and flight‑envelope protection are recommended.

**Active control sidesticks and actuator control units**: BAE Systems provides active control sidesticks and actuator control units on JetZero's BWB demonstrator; Moog supplies flight‑control actuators; Safran provides pilot‑control hardware; and Woodward supplies trim‑control modules ([militaryaerospace.com](https://militaryaerospace.com), [airframer.com](https://airframer.com)). Active sidesticks offer tactile feedback and electronic coupling, improving pilot awareness and reducing workload.

**High‑performance avionics processors**: Honeywell and NXP integrate i.MX 8 and S32N safety controllers into the Anthem cockpit. These processors enable real‑time data fusion, AI workloads, predictive maintenance and cybersecurity ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). BWB‑Q100 should adopt modular compute modules (e.g., NXP S32N, i.MX 9) with open‐architecture connectivity (Ethernet TSN, AFDX) for scalability.

**Modular open systems architecture (MOSA)**: Software‑defined avionics decouple hardware from software, allowing functions to run on generic modules. MOSA standards enable plug‑and‑play integration, reduce obsolescence and support rapid upgrades ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). Implementing MOSA within BWB‑Q100's integrated modular avionics (ATA‑42) will facilitate lifecycle upgrades and vendor diversification.

**Satellite‑based navigation and connectivity**: Satellite‑based augmentation systems (SBAS) like EGNOS/WAAS improve GPS accuracy, while low‑earth‑orbit (LEO) constellations (Starlink, OneWeb) deliver high‑speed connectivity. Anti‑jamming measures and inertial reference back‑ups are essential to counter spoofing ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). BWB‑Q100 should integrate multi‑GNSS receivers with anti‑spoofing, SBAS, inertial navigation and secure LEO connectivity for real‑time data sharing and predictive maintenance (ATA‑34, ATA‑46).

### Sensors and Digital Instrumentation

**Large‑area displays and enhanced cockpit interfaces**: New cockpits employ large‑area touch displays with modular widgets and AI‑driven decision aids. The Honeywell Anthem cockpit emphasises intuitive UI, real‑time predictive alerts and cloud connectivity ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). For BWB‑Q100, the flight deck should include large‑format displays integrated with augmented‑reality overlays, advanced synoptics and reconfigurable layouts (ATA‑23, ATA‑31, ATA‑46).

**Health‑monitoring sensors**: Built‑in test equipment, vibration sensors and structural health monitoring support predictive maintenance and reduced downtime. Integration with digital‑twin models enables condition‑based maintenance ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). Deploying distributed sensors across the airframe and engines will support the digital‑twin framework described below.

## 2. Software innovations

### Software‑Defined Avionics and Open Architectures

**Software‑defined avionics (SDA)** decouple functionality from hardware, allowing new features via software updates. Advances in microelectronics (down to 2 nm nodes) enable real‑time AI and sensor fusion ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). Implementing SDA with robust separation kernels (ARINC 653 or Open VPX) allows virtualization of multiple safety‑critical functions on shared hardware.

**AI‑driven cockpit and decision support**: Honeywell/NXP's AI‑driven cockpit provides real‑time predictive maintenance, trajectory optimisation and enhanced situational awareness ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). Integrating machine‑learning models into BWB‑Q100's avionics could assist with 4‑D trajectory planning, automated hazard recognition, and pilot‑in‑the‑loop autonomy.

**Cybersecurity frameworks**: Aviation faces rising GPS spoofing and ransomware attacks; 98 % of aviation cyber decision‑makers deploy AI‑based intrusion detection ([aviationtoday.com](https://aviationtoday.com)). BWB‑Q100 avionics must implement zero‑trust architectures, layered intrusion detection, hardware‑rooted security, encryption and anomaly detection across networks (ATA‑46, ATA‑23). Design software should adopt secure‑boot and run‑time integrity monitoring.

### Digital Twins and Model‑Based Systems Engineering

**Digital twin and industrial metaverse**: JetZero uses Siemens Xcelerator to create a digital twin of the BWB aircraft, capturing structure, manufacturing and operational states ([compositesworld.com](https://compositesworld.com)). A digital twin for BWB‑Q100 avionics can simulate network latency, processor loads, fault propagation and maintenance impacts. The industrial metaverse enables interactive troubleshooting and training. Incorporating this into the VP (virtual prototyping) pipeline will de‑risk integration and support certification.

**Model‑based systems engineering (MBSE)**: Integrate SysML/UML models of avionics architecture, capturing requirements, interfaces, and hazards. MOSA and open‑interface standards should be referenced. MBSE integrates with quantum‑enhanced optimization (QOx) to accelerate scheduling and routing problems (e.g., network configuration, crew scheduling).

## 3. Application to BWB‑Q100 EDI Domain

### CAI – AI Integration in Electronic Systems

- Integrate active control sidesticks and FBW computers into the CAI model. Use human‑factors simulations to evaluate tactile feedback and pilot‑machine interface.
