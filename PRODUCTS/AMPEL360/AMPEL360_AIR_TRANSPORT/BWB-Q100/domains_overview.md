# BWB-Q100 Domains

Domain-organized engineering and development structure for the BWB-Q100 blended wing body aircraft project.

## Domain Architecture

The BWB-Q100 project is organized into 15 specialized domains, each following the **Domain → Process (CAx/QOx) → ATA** structure for clean navigation and traceability.

### Process Structure

Each domain contains three main process categories:

#### CAx (Computer-Aided Processes)
Classical engineering processes including design, analysis, manufacturing, and validation:
- **CAD** — Computer-Aided Design
- **CAE** — Computer-Aided Engineering  
- **CFD** — Computational Fluid Dynamics
- **CAM** — Computer-Aided Manufacturing
- **CAPP** — Computer-Aided Process Planning
- **VP** — Virtual Prototyping
- **PDM-PLM** — Product Data Management / Product Lifecycle Management
- **SCM** — Supply Chain Management
- **MRP-ERP** — Materials Resource Planning / Enterprise Resource Planning
- **CIM** — Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
- **CAI** — Computer-Aided Intelligence
- **CAA** — Computer-Aided Automation
- **CASE** — Computer-Aided Software Engineering
- **KBE** — Knowledge-Based Engineering
- **CAT** — Computer-Aided Testing

#### QOx (Quantum-Optimized Processes)
Quantum-enhanced counterparts to CAx processes using QAIM-2 framework:
- Quantum optimization via QUBO/BQM formulations
- QAOA and Quantum Annealing implementations
- VQE for materials and chemistry problems
- Hybrid classical-quantum workflows

#### ATA (Air Transport Association Documentation)
Aerospace industry standard documentation structure:
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Certification evidence and compliance
- System integration documentation
- Sustainability metrics and lifecycle assessment

## Navigation Guidelines

### Finding Your Work Area
Navigate using the pattern: `domains/<DOMAIN>/{cax|qox}/<PROCESS>/` for engineering work, and `domains/<DOMAIN>/ata/ATA-XX/` for documentation.

**Examples:**
- Wing CFD analysis: `AAA/cax/CFD/`
- Wing quantum optimization: `AAA/qox/CFD/`  
- Wing documentation: `AAA/ata/ATA-57/`

### Cross-Domain Coordination
For work spanning multiple domains:
1. **Primary ownership** in the most responsible domain
2. **Cross-links** from secondary domains' ATA folders
3. **Shared evidence** via QS/UTCS references

## Quantum Integration (QAIM-2)

Each domain implements quantum-enhanced processes following the QAIM-2 framework:

### Implementation Phases
1. **Now/Pilot**: Supply chain, scheduling, resource allocation
2. **Pilot Programs**: Design optimization, manufacturing efficiency
3. **Research**: Advanced simulation, multi-physics optimization

### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: Solution quality, convergence, scalability
- **Sustainability**: Emissions reduction, energy efficiency, material optimization
- **Business**: Development time reduction, cost optimization, quality improvement

## Templates & Standards

### Available Templates
- **[QOx Problem Template](../_templates/qox_problem_template.json)** — Standard quantum optimization problem format
- **[ATA Chapter Template](../_templates/ata_chapter_template.md)** — Standard ATA documentation format

### Quality Standards
- **QS/UTCS**: Quantum Seal / Universal Traceability for all quantum runs
- **MAL-EEM**: Ethics & Empathy Module validation required
- **SIM Integration**: Sustainability Impact Model metrics tracking
- **Evidence-Based**: All claims supported by traceable evidence
