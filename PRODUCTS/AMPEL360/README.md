# AMPEL360 — Aerospace Manned Products Ending Line (360° circularity assurance)

This space groups **crewed AMPEL360 products** under a single, auditable hub with **360° circularity assurance** objectives and AQUA-OPEN bridges for classical→quantum extensibility.

---

## Quick navigation

- **BWB-Q100 (Transport Civil × Air)** → `./BWB-Q100/`
  - CAD Wing Baseline (AAA→cax→CAD) → `./BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/cax/CAD/wing_baseline_model/`
  - Master Params → `./BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/cax/CAD/wing_baseline_model/master_model/params.yaml`
  - (Optional) ATA-57 S1000D → `./BWB-Q100/ata/57/`
- **Evidence & QS anchors** → see [Evidence & Provenance](#evidence--provenance-qsutcs).

---

## Scope & objectives

**Scope:** Manned AMPEL360 products and their configurations, artifacts, and certification evidence across the lifecycle.

**Objectives:**
- Verifiable sustainability (SIM KPIs) with circularity-by-design.
- Certifiable safety & compliance (CS-25 family, ARP4754A/4761).
- Reproducible data flows across **CB→QB→UE→FE→FWD→QS** with UTCS/DET provenance.

---

## Product family (current)

- **BWB-Q100** — Baseline passenger configuration *(active)*  
  Path: `./BWB-Q100/`

_Reserved:_ additional variants can be added as subfolders under `./` following the same governance pattern.

## Directory layout (product hub)

```

ASI-T2/PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/
├─ README.md                          # This file (UTCS-headed)
└─ BWB-Q100/                          # Product instance (baseline)
├─ domains/AAA/cax/CAD/wing\_baseline\_model/...

## Domain → Process → ATA entry points (BWB-Q100)

- **AAA / cax / CAD** (geometry & structures)  
  `./BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/cax/CAD/wing_baseline_model/`
- Additional entries (add as they materialize):  
  **PPP / cax / CAE** (structures), **QQQ / cax / CFD** (aero), **ATA-57** publications.

---

## Sustainability KPI pack (SIM)

Track at product level; store under **QS** with UTCS headers:

- **Core:** CO₂e/RPK, Energy/RPK, LCA (cradle→grave), Circularity Index (materials reuse), SAF/H₂ share.
- **Operations:** NOx vs ref, noise margins, maintenance waste, supply-chain risk.
- **Governance:** audit trail of assumptions, datasets, and model versions.

> Suggested path: `./BWB-Q100/QS/kpis.yaml` (UTCS-MI v5.0 + `canonical_hash`).

---

## Compliance & certification stack

- **Airworthiness:** CS-25, ARP4754A (development assurance), ARP4761 (safety).  
- **Avionics SW/HW (if applicable):** DO-178C / DO-254.  
- **Data & docs:** S1000D Issue 6.0, ATA Spec mappings.  
- **Provenance:** UTCS/DET anchors; reproducible pipelines with CI logs archived in QS.

---

## Evidence & Provenance (QS/UTCS)

- **DET anchor:** Set `canonical_hash` for each UTCS-headed artifact at release cut (SHA-256 of content).  
- **Signatures:** Store EIP-712-style signature blocks in `./BWB-Q100/QS/` alongside artifact manifests.  
- **Reproducibility:** Derived geometry/meshes must trace to `master_model/params.yaml` with deterministic build steps.

---

## CI & automation hooks

- **Validation:** CI should run schema + grammar checks on both canonical and product-scoped paths, e.g.:
  - `PRODUCTS/AMPEL360/BWB-Q100/domains/AAA/cax/CAD/wing_baseline_model`
- **Gates:** UTCS front-matter presence; YAML/JSON schema; path grammar; QS signature verification (when enabled).
- **Outputs:** Attach CI logs as QS evidence for release tags.

---

## Versioning & change control

- Bump `version` semantically (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) on governance changes.  
- Update `release_date` and recompute `canonical_hash`.  
- Record deltas in **Changelog** and create a signed QS manifest for each release.

---

## Contribution & PR conventions

- Branch naming: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `ci/…`.  
- Commit example:  
  `feat(AAA/CAD): scaffold wing_baseline_model with UTCS headers and param packs`
- PR checklist: UTCS headers, schema pass, CI green, QS updates (when relevant).

---

## Contacts & ownership

- **Maintainer:** Robbbo-T / ASI-T Architecture Team  
- **Domain leads:** listed per product instance (see `./BWB-Q100/OWNERS.md` if present).
