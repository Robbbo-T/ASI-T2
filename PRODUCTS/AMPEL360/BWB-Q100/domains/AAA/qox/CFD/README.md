# AAA/QOx/CFD — Quantum-Optimized Computational Fluid Dynamics

Design of experiments selection and operating point optimization for BWB-Q100 aerodynamic analysis and validation.

## Quantum Process Overview

Quantum optimization of aerodynamic design points, test case selection, and multi-point design optimization using QUBO/BQM formulations.

**Primary Focus**: Operating point optimization, design of experiments, and aerodynamic configuration selection.

## Quantum Methods & Applications

### Problem Formulations
- **QUBO**: Discrete design point selection, configuration choices
- **BQM**: Multi-objective aerodynamic trade-offs (drag vs. lift)
- **Max-SAT**: Design constraint satisfaction across flight envelope

### Quantum Algorithms
- **QAOA**: Medium-scale design point optimization (50-200 variables)
- **Quantum Annealing**: Large-scale configuration optimization (500+ variables)
- **VQE**: Optimal flow condition selection

## Key Optimization Problems

### 2. Operating Condition Optimization
```
Objective: Optimize high-lift performance vs. cruise efficiency
Variables: Flap settings (discrete), angle of attack range
