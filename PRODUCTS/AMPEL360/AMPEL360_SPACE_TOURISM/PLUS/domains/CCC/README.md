# CCC — Cockpit, Cabin & Cargo

Passenger experience systems, cockpit design, and cabin systems for the PLUS suborbital space tourism aircraft.

## Domain Overview

**Core Focus**: Passenger safety and experience systems, pilot interfaces, cabin life support, and space tourism specific amenities optimized for suborbital flight.

**Key Systems**: Passenger seating, life support systems, cockpit interfaces, cabin pressurization, emergency systems, and space tourism experience enhancement.

## Process Organization

### CAx (Computer-Aided Processes)
- **[CAD](./cax/CAD/)** — Cabin layout design, seating systems, cockpit interface modeling
- **[CAE](./cax/CAE/)** — Life support analysis, cabin structural analysis, emergency system validation
- **[VP](./cax/VP/)** — Virtual cabin experience, passenger flow simulation, emergency procedures
- **[PDM-PLM](./cax/PDM-PLM/)** — Cabin configuration control, passenger safety documentation

### QOx (Quantum-Optimized Processes)
- **[CAD](./qox/CAD/)** — Cabin layout optimization via QUBO/BQM → QAOA/Annealing
- **[VP](./qox/VP/)** — Passenger experience optimization using quantum methods

### PAx (Packaging & Applications)
- **[PAx](./pax/)** — Passenger system packaging with safety certification and UTCS/QS evidence

### ATA Documentation (Space Tourism Cabin Adapted)
- **[ATA-25](./ata/ATA-25/)** — Equipment/Furnishings (space tourism cabin amenities)
- **[ATA-31](./ata/ATA-31/)** — Indicating/Recording Systems (passenger information systems)
- **[ATA-33](./ata/ATA-33/)** — Lights (cabin lighting for space experience)
- **[ATA-35](./ata/ATA-35/)** — Oxygen (life support systems)
- **[ATA-38](./ata/ATA-38/)** — Water/Waste (cabin life support)
- **[ATA-11](./ata/ATA-11/)** — Placards and Markings (passenger safety information)

## Key Optimization Targets

### Quantum-Enhanced CAx → QOx Applications
1. **Cabin Layout Optimization**: Discrete seating arrangement via QAOA for optimal passenger experience
2. **Life Support Distribution**: Quantum optimization for air/oxygen distribution systems
3. **Emergency System Placement**: Multi-objective QUBO for safety equipment positioning
4. **Passenger Flow Optimization**: Quantum routing for boarding and emergency egress

### Space Tourism Experience Levers
- **Passenger Comfort**: Optimized seating for weightlessness experience and reentry
- **Safety Systems**: Multiple redundant life support and emergency systems
- **Experience Enhancement**: Large windows, comfortable seating, smooth ride systems
- **Accessibility**: Universal design for diverse passenger capabilities

## Cross-Domain Interfaces

**Primary Dependencies**:
