# AAA/CAx/CAD — Space Vehicle Computer-Aided Design

Geometry design, structural modeling, and thermal-protection design for **AMPEL360 PLUS** aerodynamic and structural components.

## 1) Process Overview

Computer-aided design processes for space-vehicle structures, TPS (thermal protection systems), and integrated geometry optimization for suborbital tourism missions.  
**Primary focus:** vehicle outer-mold-line (OML), internal structure layout, TPS integration, manufacturability, and safety for reentry.

## 2) Key Activities

### Design Development
- Space-vehicle geometry modeling for suborbital flight profiles
- TPS design and integration (panels, seals, blankets, RCC/ceramics)
- Structural topology definition under ascent/reentry loads
- Passenger-safety system interfaces (hatches, seats, restraints)

### Optimization Targets
- Aerodynamic surface quality for reentry performance
- Structural mass minimization with margins
- TPS thermal efficiency and maintainability
- Multi-disciplinary design optimization (MDO)

### Integration Points
- **QOx/CAD:** quantum topology/layout optimization (QUBO/BQM → QAOA/Annealing)
- **CAE:** structural validation of CAD geometries
- **CFD:** aerodynamic validation of surface designs
- **Manufacturing:** space-qualified manufacturing constraint integration

## 3) Quantum Transition Path (CAx → QOx)

**Classical Limitations:** Large combinatorial design spaces for space structures, multi-objective trade-offs for safety/performance/cost  
**Quantum Opportunity:** Discrete topology choices for space structures, TPS panel layout optimization, joint placement  
**Expected Benefits:** 15-25% improvement in design efficiency, enhanced safety through expanded design space exploration

### QUBO Formulation Examples
1. **TPS Panel Placement:** Binary variables for panel locations, thermal/weight/maintainability objectives
2. **Structural Configuration:** Discrete structural elements for optimal space load distribution  
3. **Control Surface Layout:** Optimal placement for attitude control during reentry
4. **Landing System Integration:** Optimal gear placement for landing performance

## 4) Deliverables

### Design Artifacts
- Parametric space vehicle CAD models (CATIA, NX, Fusion 360)
- TPS design documentation and integration drawings
- Structural optimization reports for space loads
- Space-qualified manufacturing constraint documentation
- Mass properties and center-of-gravity analysis

### QOx Integration
- QUBO problem formulations for discrete space vehicle design choices
- Quantum optimization input files for space structures
- Classical-quantum hybrid workflow documentation for space applications
- Optimization convergence and sensitivity studies

## 5) Space Tourism Specific Considerations

- **Passenger Safety:** Integration of emergency egress systems and life support interfaces
- **Reusability:** Design for multiple flight cycles with minimal refurbishment
- **Thermal Protection:** Advanced TPS integration for passenger comfort and safety
- **Landing Performance:** Autonomous landing system integration and ground handling

## 6) Quality Assurance

- Configuration control via PDM-PLM systems
- Design review checkpoints aligned with ATA documentation
- UTCS/QS evidence sealing for all major design releases
- Cross-domain validation with CAE and CFD analyses
