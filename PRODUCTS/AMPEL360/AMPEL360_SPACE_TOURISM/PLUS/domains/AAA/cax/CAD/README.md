# AAA/CAx/CAD — Space Vehicle Computer-Aided Design

Geometry design, structural modeling, and thermal protection design for PLUS space vehicle aerodynamic and structural components.

## Process Overview

Computer-aided design processes for space vehicle structures, thermal protection systems, and integrated space vehicle geometry optimization for suborbital tourism missions.

**Primary Focus**: Space vehicle geometry, structural layout, thermal protection systems, and design optimization for reentry and passenger safety.

## Key Activities

### Design Development

- Thermal protection system design and integration
- Structural topology definition for space loads
- Passenger safety system integration

### Optimization Targets
- Aerodynamic surface optimization for reentry performance
- Structural weight minimization for space vehicle efficiency
- Thermal protection optimization for passenger safety
- Multi-disciplinary design optimization (MDO) for space tourism

### Integration Points
- **QOx/CAD**: Quantum topology optimization for space structures (QUBO/BQM → QAOA/Annealing)
- **CAE**: Structural validation of space vehicle geometries
- **CFD**: Aerodynamic validation of reentry surface designs
- **Space Manufacturing**: Space-qualified manufacturing constraint integration

## Quantum Transition Path (CAx → QOx)

**Classical Limitations**: Large combinatorial design spaces for space structures, multi-objective trade-offs for safety/performance
**Quantum Opportunity**: Discrete topology choices for space structures, thermal protection layout optimization
**Expected Benefits**: 15-25% improvement in design efficiency, enhanced safety through expanded design space exploration

### QUBO Formulation Examples
