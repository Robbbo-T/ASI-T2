# Standard Practice Manual: Composite Fastener Installation

## 1. Purpose
This document establishes standard practices for the installation of mechanical fasteners in composite structural components of the AMPEL360 PLUS space tourism vehicle.

## 2. Scope
This manual covers:
- Hole preparation in C/C and CFRP materials
- Fastener selection for space environment
- Installation procedures and torque specifications
- Quality control and inspection requirements
- Special considerations for thermal cycling

## 3. Materials & Equipment
- Space-qualified fasteners (titanium, Inconel)
- Drilling equipment for composite materials
- Torque measurement and control tools
- Inspection equipment (borescope, ultrasonic)

## 4. Procedures
### 4.1. Hole Preparation
- Proper drill bit selection for composite materials
- Delamination prevention techniques
- Hole quality inspection criteria

### 4.2. Fastener Installation
- Installation sequence and torque values
- Environmental considerations (vacuum, thermal cycling)
- Sealing and corrosion protection
