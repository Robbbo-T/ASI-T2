# ATA-57: Wings & Lifting Surfaces (AMPEL360 PLUS)

## 1. Scope and Applicability
Standards, specifications, and evidence for **wings / strakes / lifting-body surfaces** supporting suborbital ascent, reentry, and autonomous runway landing. Covers primary structure, high-temperature leading edges, TPS integration, control-surface interfaces, mass properties, and inspection.

**Key interfaces:**  
ATA-20 (Practices), ATA-32 (Landing Gear Doors TPS adjacency), ATA-53 (Body interfaces), ATA-55 (Control Surfaces), LCC/ATA-27 (Flight Controls), EEE/ATA-24 (Power), MEC/ATA-36 (Pneumatics if used).
