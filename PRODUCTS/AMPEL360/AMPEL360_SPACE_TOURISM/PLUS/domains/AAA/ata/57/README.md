## Space Tourism Adaptation

This chapter adapts traditional aircraft "wings" to **space lifting surfaces**, including control fins and aerodynamic surfaces for suborbital profiles.

**Key adaptations**
- Reentry aerodynamics for lifting surfaces  
- Thermal protection integration for lifting surfaces  
- Control-surface design for attitude control  
- Structural design for space loads and thermal cycling

---

## Scope

Space-vehicle lifting surfaces including:
- Main wing structures (if applicable)
- Control fins and stabilizers
- Aerodynamic control surfaces
- Thermal protection system (TPS) integration
- Structural interfaces and mounting systems
