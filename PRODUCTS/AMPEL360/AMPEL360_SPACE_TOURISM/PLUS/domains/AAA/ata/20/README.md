# ATA-20: Standard Practices - Airframe (AMPEL360 PLUS)

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This chapter defines the standard practices, processes, and specifications for the assembly, maintenance, and repair of the **AMPEL360 PLUS** space tourism vehicle airframe.

Unlike standard aviation practices, the procedures herein are adapted for the unique requirements of suborbital and orbital flight, including:
- Resistance to high thermal and mechanical stress cycles.
- Operation in vacuum and microgravity.
- Handling of advanced composite materials and Thermal Protection Systems (TPS).
- Sealing requirements for cabin pressurization and reentry plasma protection.

## 2. Index of Deliverables

The following are the normative documents comprising the ATA-20 chapter for this program. Each document is backed by deterministic evidence (QS) and is under strict configuration control.
