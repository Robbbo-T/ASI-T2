# Process Specification: RCC Panel Handling & Bonding

## 1. Purpose
This document establishes the mandatory procedures for handling, storage, inspection, and bonding of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels used for high-temperature leading edges on the AMPEL360 PLUS.

## 2. Materials & Equipment
- **RCC Panels**: Carbon-carbon composite with SiC coating
- **Bonding Agent**: High-temperature structural adhesive `BOND-RCC-HT-01`
- **Handling Equipment**: Vacuum lift tools, protective fixtures
- **Inspection Equipment**: Thermographic cameras, ultrasonic probes

## 3. Handling Procedures
### 3.1. Storage Requirements
- Clean room environment (Class 10,000 or better)
- Temperature controlled: 20°C ± 3°C
- Humidity controlled: < 45% RH
- Protection from mechanical damage

### 3.2. Inspection Before Use
- Visual inspection for cracks, chips, coating damage
- Dimensional verification
- Surface cleanliness verification
- Documentation of panel history

## 4. Bonding Procedures
### 4.1. Surface Preparation
- Cleaning with approved solvents
- Surface activation procedures
- Contamination control measures

### 4.2. Adhesive Application
- Environmental conditions for bonding
- Application technique and thickness control
- Cure cycle parameters
