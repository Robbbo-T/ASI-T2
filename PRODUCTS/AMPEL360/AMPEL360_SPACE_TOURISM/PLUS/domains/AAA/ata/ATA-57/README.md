# ATA-57 â€” Wings (Space Vehicle Lifting Surfaces)

Publications and evidence for **ATA-57** - Space vehicle wings and lifting surfaces adapted for suborbital space tourism operations.

## Space Tourism Adaptation

This ATA chapter has been adapted from traditional aircraft wings to address space vehicle lifting surfaces, control fins, and aerodynamic surfaces for suborbital flight profiles.

**Key Adaptations for Space Tourism:**
- Reentry aerodynamics for space vehicle wings
- Thermal protection integration for lifting surfaces
- Control surface design for space vehicle attitude control
- Structural design for space loads and thermal cycling

## Scope

Space vehicle lifting surfaces including:
- Main wing structures (if applicable)
- Control fins and stabilizers
- Aerodynamic control surfaces
- Thermal protection system integration
- Structural interfaces and mounting systems

## Documentation Categories

### Design Documentation
- Wing/lifting surface structural drawings
- Aerodynamic performance specifications
- Thermal protection system integration
