# ATA-53: Fuselage (AMPEL360 PLUS)

## 1. Scope and Applicability
Standards, specifications, and evidence for the **pressurized fuselage** of PLUS:
- **Primary shell** (panels, frames, stringers) in C/C and CFRP.
- **TPS integration** (joints, thermal gaps, seals).
- Interfaces with **ATA-20** (general practices), **ATA-56** (windows), and **ATA-32/ATA-52** (gear-bay/primary doors—primary passenger/cargo doors are covered by ATA-52).

## 2. Index of Deliverables

### 53-10: Primary Structure
> Design criteria and strength/stiffness requirements for the pressurized shell.
- **[DS-53-10-0001](./53-10_Primary_Structure/DS-53-10-0001_FuselagePrimaryStructure.md)** - Design Spec: Fuselage Primary Structure

### 53-20: Frames & Stringers (Manufacturing)
> Layup & forming rules; AFP/ATL; process control and porosity limits.
- **[PS-53-20-0001](./53-20_Frames_Stringers/PS-53-20-0001_AFP_Layup_and_Cure.md)** - Process Spec: AFP Layup & Cure Windows

### 53-30: TPS Integration & Thermal Gaps
> TPS-to-substructure bonding, thermal expansion gaps, ablative sealing.
- **[PS-53-30-0001](./53-30_TPS_Integration/PS-53-30-0001_TPS_Substructure_Bonding.md)** - Process Spec: TPS-to-Substructure Bonding

### 53-40: Cabin Pressurization & Seals
> Life support interfaces, emergency pressure relief, seal maintenance.
- **[DS-53-40-0001](./53-40_Pressurization/DS-53-40-0001_CabinPressurization.md)** - Design Spec: Cabin Pressurization Systems
