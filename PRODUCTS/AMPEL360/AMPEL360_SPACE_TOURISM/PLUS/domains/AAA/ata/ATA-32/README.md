# ATA-32: Landing Gear (AMPEL360 PLUS)

## 1. Scope and Applicability
Standards, specifications, and evidence for the **landing gear system** of PLUS space tourism vehicle, adapted for runway landing after suborbital flight:
- **Landing gear assemblies** (main and nose gear) including struts, wheels, brakes
- **Retraction/extension systems** for space vehicle configuration
- **Thermal protection integration** at gear bay interfaces
- **Ground support equipment** interfaces and operations
