# S1000D BREX (Business Rules Exchange)

This directory contains the BREX files that define the business rules and validation criteria for the ATA-20 S1000D data modules.

## Files

- [`DMC-PLS1-A-00-00-00-00A-022A-D-EN-US.xml`](./DMC-PLS1-A-00-00-00-00A-022A-D-EN-US.xml) â€” Project BREX ruleset defining validation rules for:
  - Numbers format and decimal separators
  - Torque table specifications and requirements
  - Material reference standards
  - Graphics and figure policies
  - Safety procedure encoding
  - Content duplication prevention
  - Quality and evidence requirements

## Purpose

BREX files ensure consistency and quality across all ATA-20 data modules by enforcing project-specific rules beyond the standard S1000D schema validation. These rules are automatically applied during validation and content authoring workflows.
