# QOx — Annealing Optimization

Annealing within **QOx** provides discrete optimization for AAA/CAx decision problems by formulating them as **QUBO/BQM** models and solving on **quantum annealers**, **digital annealers**, or **(GPU) simulated annealing** backends. This module standardizes problem encoding, schedules, acceptance criteria, and evidence packaging so results are **auditable, reproducible, and certifiable**.

---

## 1) Scope & Positioning

**In-scope problem classes (examples):**
- **TPS panel layout** (tile/panel selection, seams, maintainability).
- **Structural topology** (member on/off, mass vs. stiffness/buckling).
- **Hinge-line thermal barriers** (selection/placement with clearance).
- **Actuator/gear placement** (feasible bays, interference, wiring length).
- **Test-point selection / sensor placement** (observability vs. cost).
- **Mission mode sequencing** (discrete scheduling, guard constraints).

**Out of scope:** Continuous CFD/FEA solves (provided by CAx), control-law synthesis (LCC primary).

**Interfaces:**  
CAD/CAE/CFD provide **inputs** (geometry discretizations, load envelopes, thermal maps);  
**Annealing** returns **configurations** (binary decision vectors, weights, topologies) with **confidence scores**.

## 2) QUBO/BQM Formulation Standards

### 2.1) Binary Encoding
- **Decision variables:** x₀, x₁, ..., xₙ ∈ {0,1} represent discrete choices (on/off, select/reject).
- **Objective mapping:** Minimize H(x) = Σᵢⱼ Qᵢⱼ·xᵢ·xⱼ + Σᵢ hᵢ·xᵢ (QUBO matrix Q, linear bias h).
- **Constraint embedding:** Penalty methods to enforce hard constraints (sum-to-one, mutual exclusion).

### 2.2) Problem Templates
#### TPS Panel Layout
```
Variables: x_ij = 1 if panel (i,j) is selected for location k
Objective: Minimize (thermal_penalty + mass_penalty + maintenance_penalty + seam_penalty)
Constraints: Coverage constraints, overlap exclusions, geometric feasibility
```

#### Structural Topology  
```
Variables: x_i = 1 if structural member i is active
Objective: Minimize (mass + compliance_penalty)
Constraints: Connectivity, load path requirements, manufacturing constraints
```

#### Sensor Placement
```
Variables: x_i = 1 if sensor at candidate location i
Objective: Minimize (cost - observability)
Constraints: Power budget, data rate limits, accessibility requirements
```

### 2.3) Constraint Handling
- **Hard constraints:** High penalty weights (1000× typical objective scale).
- **Soft constraints:** Moderate penalties allowing trade-offs.
- **Multi-objective:** Weighted sum or Pareto front approximation via constraint relaxation.
