# PLUS Domains

Domain-organized engineering and development structure for the PLUS suborbital space tourism aircraft project.

## Domain Architecture

The PLUS space tourism aircraft implements a domain-driven engineering approach adapted for suborbital flight operations and passenger safety requirements.

### Process Structure

Each domain contains three main process categories:

#### CAx (Computer-Aided Processes)
- **CAD**: Computer-Aided Design for space vehicle geometry and structures
- **CAE**: Computer-Aided Engineering for space loads and thermal analysis
- **CFD**: Computational Fluid Dynamics for hypersonic and reentry aerodynamics
- **VP**: Virtual Prototyping for mission validation and safety analysis
- **CAI**: Computer-Aided Intelligence for autonomous systems
- **CASE**: Computer-Aided Software Engineering for safety-critical systems
- **KBE**: Knowledge-Based Engineering for design automation
- **PDM-PLM**: Product Data/Lifecycle Management for space-qualified documentation

#### QOx (Quantum-Optimized Processes)
Quantum-enhanced versions of CAx processes leveraging QAIM-2 framework:
- **QUBO/BQM**: Quadratic optimization problems for discrete design choices
- **QAOA/Annealing**: Quantum algorithms for topology and layout optimization
- **Quantum ML**: Enhanced machine learning for space tourism applications

#### ATA (Air Transport Association Documentation - Space Adapted)
Space tourism adapted technical documentation following ATA structure:
- Modified ATA chapters relevant to space vehicle operations
- Space-qualified safety and certification documentation
- Passenger safety and experience documentation
