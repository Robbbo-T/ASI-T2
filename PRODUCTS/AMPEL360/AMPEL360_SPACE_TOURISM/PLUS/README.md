## Overview

**Target:** Suborbital space tourism vehicle optimized for passenger safety, experience quality, and environmental sustainability.

**Key Features:**
- Passenger capacity: TBD (target 6-12 passengers)
- Flight profile: Suborbital trajectory with weightlessness experience
- Safety-first design with multiple redundancy systems
- Sustainable propulsion systems
- Enhanced passenger comfort and experience

**Scope anchors:**
* **Field:** Space Tourism
* **Environment:** Space (suborbital)
* **Lifecycle:** Domains to be decomposed into CAx processes with **QAIM-2** quantum augmentation (QOx)
* **Documentation:** ATA-aligned folders per domain (following BWB-Q100 pattern)
