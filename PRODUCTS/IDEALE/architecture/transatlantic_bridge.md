# Transatlantic Bridge (TA) Architecture

## Overview

The Transatlantic Bridge (TA) is the architectural layer enabling secure, verifiable, and ethics-gated collaboration between USA and European capabilities within the IDEALE federation framework.

## Position in Bridge Architecture

```

## Integration with ASI-T2

### AMPEL360 Aerospace Stack

The TA layer enables joint development of BWB-Q100 and other aerospace platforms:

```
USA Engineers ←→ [TA Bridge] ←→ EU Engineers
        ↓                              ↓
   BWB-Q100/domains/              BWB-Q100/domains/
   ├── AAA/ (Airframes)          ├── AAA/ (Airframes)
   ├── CQH/ (Quantum & H₂)       ├── CQH/ (Quantum & H₂)
   ├── PPP/ (Propulsion)         ├── PPP/ (Propulsion)
   └── ...                       └── ...
```

**Workflow:**
1. Engineers collaborate within domain structure (ata/, cax/, qox/, pax/)
2. Changes tracked with UTCS-MI provenance
3. Export control automated checks before cross-Atlantic sync
4. Peer review and approval via TA governance
5. QS sealing at integration milestones

### INFRANET Services

- **AQUA_OS_AIRCRAFT:** Joint avionics development (ARINC-653 standard)
- **LH2_CORRIDOR:** Transatlantic hydrogen infrastructure coordination
- **QAIM:** Shared quantum computing resources for optimization

### GAIA Ecosystem

- **GAIA-AIR:** Urban Air Mobility certification harmonization
- **GAIA-SPACE:** Joint space tourism and exploration ventures
- **GAIA-SEA:** Atlantic maritime logistics optimization

### Threat Model & Mitigations

**Threat:** Unauthorized technology transfer
**Mitigation:** Automated export control checks, human oversight, audit trails

**Threat:** Intelligence compromise
**Mitigation:** Zero-knowledge proofs, compartmentalization, quantum encryption

**Threat:** Supply chain attacks
**Mitigation:** SBOM verification, blockchain provenance, cryptographic signatures

**Threat:** Insider threats
**Mitigation:** Continuous monitoring, anomaly detection, multi-party approval

**Threat:** Nation-state adversaries
**Mitigation:** Defense-in-depth, quantum-resistant cryptography, air gaps for critical systems

## Data Sovereignty & Privacy

### Principles

1. **Data Minimization:** Only share what's necessary for collaboration
2. **Purpose Limitation:** Data used only for authorized purposes
3. **Storage Location:** Respect national requirements on data residency
4. **Deletion Rights:** Clear data retention and deletion policies
5. **Transparency:** Users know what data is shared and with whom

### Implementation
