# IDEALE Architecture

System architecture for IDEALE capability mesh and transatlantic bridge.

## Overview

Describes the overall system design, integration patterns, and technical architecture for both European operations and transatlantic USA-EU cooperation.

## Core Architecture Documents

### Bridge Architecture
- **[Transatlantic Bridge (TA)](./transatlantic_bridge.md)** — Architecture for USA-Europe coordination layer

### Domain Architectures
- **[COP](./COP/)** — Common Operating Picture
- **[Energy Corridor](./energy_corridor/)** — Energy infrastructure
- **[Aerospace Stack](./aerospace_stack/)** — Aerospace integration
- **[Logistics Mesh](./logistics_mesh/)** — Logistics network

## Bridge Flow: CB→QB→UE→FE→TA→FWD→QS

1. **CB (Capability Bridge):** Domain integration across Intelligence, Defence, Energy, Aerospace, Logistics
2. **QB (Quantum Bridge):** Quantum-classical optimization layer
3. **UE (Unified Engineering):** Development environment and tools
4. **FE (Federated Europe):** European deployment and operations
5. **TA (Transatlantic):** USA-EU coordination and capability exchange
6. **FWD (Forward):** Edge/field operations globally
7. **QS (Quality Sealing):** Cryptographic verification and attestation

## Integration Points

- **Parent:** [IDEALE Root](../../README.md)
- **Related:** See IDEALE documentation structure

## UTCS-MI Compliance

This module follows UTCS-MI v5.0 provenance standards:
- Full traceability to source requirements
- QS sealing at integration points
- Ethics gate evaluation (MAL-EEM)
- Export control compliance

## Contribution Guidelines

All changes must:
1. Include UTCS-MI front-matter
2. Pass ethics gate evaluation
3. Maintain export control compliance
4. Update canonical_hash after changes
