# IDEALE Governance

Governance framework for IDEALE federated capability mesh.

## Overview

Defines policies, procedures, and compliance requirements for IDEALE operations, including frameworks for transatlantic USA-Europe cooperation.

## Core Documents

### Transatlantic Federation
- **[Transatlantic Vision](./transatlantic_vision.md)** — Strategic framework for USA-Europe federation
- **[Transatlantic Cooperation Charter](./FE_charters/transatlantic_cooperation_charter.md)** — Governance, integration, and compliance for Atlantic partnership

### Federated Europe Charters
- **[FE Charters](./FE_charters/)** — European federation agreements and protocols

## Governance Principles

1. **Federated Structure:** Enable multi-stakeholder collaboration while respecting sovereignty
2. **Ethics-First:** MAL-EEM evaluation gates all strategic decisions
3. **Evidence-Driven:** UTCS-MI provenance for full traceability
4. **Standards-Based:** Compliance with international safety, security, and documentation standards
5. **Transparency:** Open governance with clear decision-making processes

## Integration Points

## UTCS-MI Compliance

This module follows UTCS-MI v5.0 provenance standards:
- Full traceability to source requirements
