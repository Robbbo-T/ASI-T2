# IDEALE — Intelligence · Defence · Energy · Aerospace · Logistics · Europe

Federated European capability mesh fusing **intelligence, defence, energy, aerospace, and logistics** into a single verifiable operating picture and decision pipeline.

## 🎯 Purpose & Posture

- **Purpose:** Federated capability mesh with a single, cryptographically attested COP and decision pipeline.
- **Posture:** Dual-use (civil + defence), evidence-driven, export-controlled, **ethics-gated (MAL‑EEM)**.
- **Backbone:** UTCS-MI provenance + QS sealing; CB→QB→UE→FE→FWD→QS bridge; ASI‑T2 meta‑OS services.

```

## 🔐 Security & Ethics

All IDEALE operations are:
- **Ethics-gated:** MAL-EEM (Moral AI Laboratory Ethics Evaluation Matrix)
- **Export-controlled:** Dual-use technology restrictions apply
- **Evidence-driven:** Full UTCS-MI provenance chain
- **QS-sealed:** Cryptographic attestation at decision points

## 🌉 Bridge Architecture

**CB → QB → UE → FE → FWD → QS**

- **CB:** Capability Bridge (domain integration)
- **QB:** Quantum Bridge (optimization layer)
- **UE:** Unified Engineering (development)
- **FE:** Federated Europe (deployment)
- **FWD:** Forward operations (edge/field)
- **QS:** Quality Sealing (verification)

## UTCS-MI Compliance

This module follows UTCS-MI v5.0 provenance standards:
- Full traceability to source requirements
- QS sealing at integration points
- Ethics gate evaluation (MAL-EEM)
- Export control compliance

## Contribution Guidelines

All changes must:
1. Include UTCS-MI front-matter
2. Pass ethics gate evaluation
3. Maintain export control compliance
4. Update canonical_hash after changes
