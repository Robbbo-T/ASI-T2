# LH2-CORRIDOR — Cross-Field  × Cross-Environment --> complete value chain

An end-to-end, digitally-twinned, and quantum-optimized value chain for the production, storage, transport, and delivery of green liquid hydrogen (LH2). This product is a critical enabler for zero-emission aviation and other sustainable industries under the ASI-T2 portfolio.

This README is organized **Domain → Process (CAx/QOx) → ATA** for clean navigation and traceability.

## Overview

Target: A highly-efficient and resilient liquid hydrogen supply chain, from renewable energy source to point-of-use (e.g., airport refueling). The corridor is optimized for **production cost ↓**, **transport losses ↓** (boil-off), **delivery reliability (OTIF) ↑**, and end-to-end **GHG footprint ↓**.

Engineering follows the mandatory TFA-ONLY path grammar, UIX.v1, and MAL-EEM ethics. Every major logistical or engineering decision emits QS/UTCS evidence.

**Scope anchors**

*   **Field:** Cross-Value Chain
*   **Environment:** Cross-Environment (integrating ground, sea, and air logistics)
*   **Lifecycle:** Domains decomposed into CAx processes with **QAIM-2** quantum augmentation (QOx).
*   **Documentation:** ATA-aligned folders per domain, adapted for industrial infrastructure.

## Workflows

1.  **Model (CAx)** → Commit classical models (e.g., network graphs, plant designs, tank CAD) in `domains/<CODE>/cax/<PHASE>/`.
2.  **Encode (QOx)** → For optimization targets, formulate the problem as a QUBO/BQM and commit to `domains/<CODE>/qox/<PHASE>/problems/`.
3.  **Solve** → Execute quantum or hybrid solvers. Results are automatically archived in `domains/<CODE>/qox/<PHASE>/runs/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` with a QS/UTCS seal.
4.  **Document (ATA)** → Update the analogous ATA chapter in `domains/<CODE>/ata/ATA-XX/` with the design rationale, QOx results, and links to the evidence.
5.  **Gate** → All Pull Requests are gated by the inclusion of UTCS anchors and a successful MAL-EEM compliance check.

## Evidence & Compliance

*   **UTCS/QS:** Every major decision, from network design to production schedules, is sealed with deterministic evidence for full auditability.
*   **Ethics:** The MAL-EEM guard monitors the digital twin for potential negative externalities (e.g., impacts on local energy grids, unsafe operating conditions) and ensures fair, transparent resource allocation.
*   **Standards:** Documentation follows analogous industrial and aerospace standards (e.g., ISO for cryogenics, ATA for airport interfaces) to ensure safety and interoperability. Green hydrogen provenance is tracked via a blockchain ledger managed under the `LIB` domain.

---

## Glossary & Acronyms

*   **Boil-off**: The evaporation of a cryogenic liquid like LH2 due to heat ingress. A primary source of loss.
*   **Digital Twin**: A real-time, virtual simulation of the entire LH2 corridor, managed by the **IIS** domain.
*   **Electrolyzer**: A device that uses electricity (ideally renewable) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
*   **Green Hydrogen**: Hydrogen produced using renewable energy, resulting in near-zero lifecycle emissions.
*   **LH2**: Liquid Hydrogen.
*   **Liquefaction**: The process of cooling hydrogen gas to approximately -253°C (-423°F) to turn it into a liquid.
*   **OTIF**: On-Time In-Full; a key logistics performance indicator.
*   **Provenance**: The documented history of an asset. Here, used to certify that the LH2 is "green".

## LH2-CORRIDOR — FAQ

**Q1. What is the LH2-CORRIDOR in simple terms?**
It's the entire supply chain for liquid hydrogen, designed as a single, integrated product. It covers everything from making the hydrogen with renewable power to delivering it to an airport for fueling an aircraft like the BWB-Q100.

**Q2. How is this different from a vehicle product like BWB-Q100?**
The LH2-CORRIDOR is an **infrastructure** product. Its components are production plants, storage tanks, transport vehicles, and pipelines, all connected by a central digital brain. BWB-Q100 is a **vehicle** that consumes the fuel delivered by the corridor. They are two symbiotic but distinct products in the ASI-T2 portfolio.

**Q3. I'm a logistics planner. Where is my work located?**
Your work is central to this product and resides in the **LIB (Logistics, Inventory & Blockchain)** domain.
*   Network design and routing: `domains/LIB/cax/SCM/`
*   Inventory and boil-off models: `domains/LIB/cax/MRP-ERP/`
*   Quantum optimization of these problems: `domains/LIB/qox/`

**Q4. What is the biggest quantum optimization challenge for this project?**
The **network design and inventory management** problem, handled by the `LIB` domain. Deciding where to build multi-billion dollar facilities while simultaneously managing a constantly decaying (boil-off) inventory across a global network is an extraordinarily complex problem. Quantum optimization offers a path to a globally optimal solution that classical methods cannot find.

**Q5. How is the safety of handling large amounts of liquid hydrogen managed?**
Safety is paramount and is primarily owned by the **CQH (Cryogenics, Quantum & H₂)** domain. This includes:
*   Safe cryo-tank design (`cax/CAD`, `cax/CAE`).
*   Fire/leak protection systems (`ata/ATA-26`).
*   Pressurized system management (`ata/ATA-36`).
*   Operational procedures documented in `domains/CQH/ata/`.

**Q6. What does "digitally-twinned" mean for the corridor?**
It means we have a complete, real-time virtual model of the entire supply chain running in the **IIS** domain. Every tank level, vehicle position, energy price, and production rate is mirrored in the digital twin. This allows us to simulate future scenarios, predict disruptions, and use quantum optimization to make real-time adjustments to the entire network.

**Q7. How do you guarantee the hydrogen is "green"?**
This is handled by the blockchain-based provenance system in the **LIB** domain. Every batch of hydrogen produced is given a "digital passport" that cryptographically links it to the specific renewable energy certificates used to create it. This passport is tracked immutably across the entire supply chain, providing an auditable guarantee of its green credentials at the point of use.
