# AAA/CAx/CAD — Aerodynamic & Airframe Computer-Aided Design

Geometry design, topology optimization, and parametric modeling for BWB-Q100 aerodynamic and structural components.

## Process Overview

Computer-aided design processes for aerodynamic surfaces, airframe structures, and integrated BWB geometry optimization.

**Primary Focus**: Wing geometry, fuselage integration, structural layout, parametric modeling, and design optimization.

## Key Activities

### Design Development
- Parametric wing geometry modeling
- Blended wing-body integration design
- Structural topology definition
- Manufacturing constraint integration

### Optimization Targets
- Aerodynamic surface optimization for drag reduction
- Structural weight minimization
- Manufacturing feasibility integration
- Multi-disciplinary design optimization (MDO)

### Integration Points
- **QOx/CAD**: Quantum topology optimization (QUBO/BQM → QAOA/Annealing)
- **CAE**: Structural validation of CAD geometries
- **CFD**: Aerodynamic validation of surface designs
- **Manufacturing**: DfM constraint integration

## Quantum Transition Path (CAx → QOx)

**Classical Limitations**: Large combinatorial design spaces, multi-objective trade-offs
**Quantum Opportunity**: Discrete topology choices, layout optimization
**Expected Benefits**: 5-15% improvement in design efficiency, expanded design space exploration

### QUBO Formulation Examples
1. **Wing Rib Placement**: Binary variables for rib locations, structural/weight objectives
2. **Panel Configuration**: Discrete panel sizes and orientations for manufacturing
3. **Joint Location**: Optimal structural joint placement for load distribution
