# AAA/QOx/CAD — Quantum-Optimized Computer-Aided Design

Quantum-enhanced topology optimization and design space exploration for BWB-Q100 aerodynamic and structural components.

## Quantum Process Overview

Quantum optimization of discrete design choices in aerodynamic and structural systems using QUBO/BQM formulations solved via QAOA/Annealing.

**Primary Focus**: Topology optimization, discrete design variable optimization, and multi-objective design trade-offs.

## Quantum Methods & Applications

### Problem Formulations
- **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)**: Discrete topology and layout choices
- **BQM (Binary Quadratic Model)**: Multi-objective design optimization with constraints
- **Max-SAT**: Design rule satisfaction and constraint handling

### Quantum Algorithms
- **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)**: Design space exploration
- **Quantum Annealing**: Large-scale topology optimization
- **VQE**: Material property optimization in design

## Key Optimization Problems

### 1. Wing Structural Topology
```
Objective: Minimize weight while maintaining structural performance
Variables: Rib placement (binary), spar configuration (discrete)
Constraints: Load path requirements, manufacturing limits
Method: QUBO → Quantum Annealing (1000-5000 variables)
```

### 2. Panel Configuration Optimization
```
Objective: Minimize manufacturing cost + weight penalty
Variables: Panel sizes (discrete), joint locations (binary)
Constraints: Aerodynamic smoothness, access requirements
Method: BQM → QAOA (100-500 variables)
```

### 3. Multi-Material Layout
```
Objective: Optimize material distribution for performance/cost
Variables: Material selection per element (discrete)
Constraints: Compatibility, manufacturing, certification
Method: QUBO Max-SAT → Quantum Annealing
```

## Integration Workflow

1. **Problem Encoding**: CAx design problem → QUBO/BQM formulation
2. **Quantum Solve**: QAOA/Annealing → candidate solutions
3. **Classical Refinement**: Continuous variable optimization
4. **CAx Validation**: Geometry reconstruction and performance verification
5. **Documentation**: QS/UTCS evidence generation

## Hardware Requirements

### Current (Pilot Phase)
- **Quantum Annealer**: 1000-5000 qubits for topology problems
- **Gate-based**: 100-500 qubits for QAOA applications
- **Classical**: GPU cluster for pre/post-processing

### Expected Benefits
