## Overview

The ASI-T2 portfolio encompasses a range of advanced aerospace systems, each developed under a strict set of governing principles to ensure safety, sustainability, and performance.

**Core Governance & Architecture Principles:**

*   **TFA (Top Federation Algorithm / Threading Final Assembly):** A federated architecture that provides a single, auditable thread from design to certification for every product.
*   **UIX (Universal Injection Prompt):** Mandatory pre-flight rules enforced on all human and AI agents before executing tasks.
*   **MAL-EEM (Ethics & Empathy Module):** A fail-closed ethics and safety guardrail active across all systems and processes.
*   **UTCS / QS (Universal Traceability & Configuration System / Quantum Seal):** A mandatory evidence standard, generating deterministic provenance anchors for every significant engineering action.

## Unified Product Development Framework

Every ASI-T2 product directory is structured identically to ensure seamless navigation, interoperability, and process standardization. This is achieved through the mandatory **Domain → Process → ATA** model.

### Standard Product Directory Structure

```
{field}_{environment}_{product-name}/
└── domains/
    ├── <DOMAIN_CODE_1>/
    │   ├── cax/
    │   │   ├── <PROCESS_1>/  // e.g., CAD, CAE, CFD
    │   │   └── <PROCESS_2>/
    │   ├── qox/
    │   │   ├── <PROCESS_1>/
    │   │   └── <PROCESS_2>/
    │   └── ata/
    │       ├── <ATA_CHAPTER_1>/
    │       └── <ATA_CHAPTER_2>/
    └── <DOMAIN_CODE_2>/
        └── ...
```

### Framework Components

*   **`domains/`**: The primary decomposition of engineering work into areas of subject matter expertise (e.g., `AAA` for Aerodynamics, `PPP` for Propulsion). This organizes all data and models by technical function.
*   **`cax/` (Computer-Aided X):** The home for all **classical** engineering artifacts. This includes models, simulations, and data from processes like CAD, CAE, CFD, CAM, and SCM.
*   **`qox/` (Quantum-Optimized X):** The quantum counterpart to `cax/`. This is where classical optimization problems are encoded into quantum-compatible formats (QUBO/BQM), solved using quantum or hybrid algorithms, and analysed.
*   **`ata/` (ATA Spec 100):** The home for all formal, certifiable documentation. Each folder corresponds to an ATA chapter (e.g., `ATA-32` for Landing Gear), providing a single source of truth for design rationale, test evidence, and compliance.

## QAIM-2 Integration Framework

The **Quantum AI Model for Quantum Augmented/Accelerated Industrial Management (QAIM-2)** is the core optimization framework for the ASI-T2 portfolio. It provides the methodology for translating complex classical problems into quantum computations to drive measurable sustainability and performance improvements.

**The QAIM-2 Process Flow:**

1.  **Identify Classical Problem (in `cax/`)**: An engineering challenge is identified (e.g., optimizing a wing's topology for weight and drag).
2.  **Encode with QAIM-2 (to `qox/`)**: The problem is mathematically formulated as a QUBO/BQM, mapping engineering objectives to a cost function.
3.  **Solve with Quantum/Hybrid Methods**: The QUBO is solved using quantum annealing or gate-based algorithms (QAOA, VQE).
4.  **Analyze & Integrate (back to `cax/`)**: The optimized solution is decoded, validated, and fed back into classical engineering tools (e.g., updating the CAD model).
5.  **Measure Sustainability Impact (SIM)**: The impact of the optimization is quantified against the **Sustainable Industry Model (SIM)** levers (e.g., fuel burn reduction, material waste reduction).
6.  **Document with Evidence (in `ata/`)**: The entire process, including the QS/UTCS-sealed run, is documented in the relevant ATA chapter.

This closed-loop process is applied consistently across all products to ensure that quantum optimization delivers tangible, auditable benefits.
