# ORBITAL-MACHINES — Debris Removal, Assembly & Servicing

Autonomous orbital robotics systems optimized for space debris removal, on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and space infrastructure maintenance. This product line addresses the growing need for sustainable space operations and orbital ecosystem preservation.

---

## Overview

Target: Autonomous orbital systems optimized for **debris capture efficiency ↑**, **mission success rate ↑**, **operational safety ↑**, and **space sustainability ↑**. Engineering follows the mandatory TFA-ONLY path grammar, UIX.v1, and MAL-EEM ethics. Every milestone emits QS/UTCS evidence.

**Scope anchors**

* **Field:** Orbital Robotics & Space Services
* **Environment:** Space (LEO, MEO, GEO orbits)
* **Lifecycle:** Domains decomposed into CAx processes with **QAIM-2** quantum augmentation (QOx)
* **Documentation:** ATA-aligned folders adapted for space robotics systems
