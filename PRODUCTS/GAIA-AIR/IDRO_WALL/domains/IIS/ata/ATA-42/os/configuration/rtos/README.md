# RTOS Configuration

Real-time operating system and board support package configuration.

## Purpose

Platform-specific configuration for the IMA operating system, including:
- Hardware initialization
- Device drivers
- Boot sequence
- System services
- Board support package (BSP)

## Configuration Files

Configuration files in this directory define:

### Hardware Configuration
- Processor type and speed
- Memory layout (RAM, ROM, flash)
- Peripheral devices and addresses
- Interrupt vectors
- DMA channels

### RTOS Parameters
- Kernel configuration
- Task priorities
- Stack sizes
- System timers
- Clock sources

### Boot Configuration
- Boot sequence and initialization order
- Self-tests and diagnostics
- Partition loading
- Health monitoring startup

## Platform Dependencies

Configuration is platform-specific and must be validated for:
- Target hardware compatibility
- Timing requirements
- Resource availability
- Safety constraints

## Integration

RTOS configuration integrates with:
- ARINC-653 partition definitions (partition.xml)
- Schedule requirements (schedule.xml)
- Health monitoring system
- Platform health manager
