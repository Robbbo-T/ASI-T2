<!-- Example:
### DECISION-001: ARINC-653 Major Frame Selection (2025-10-01)

**Context:** Initial IMA schedule design required major frame duration selection.

**Decision:** Selected 100 ms major frame with three windows for partitions.

**Rationale:** Provides adequate time slots for SwarmCore (40ms), MissionPlanner (40ms), and MAL-EEM (20ms) while maintaining 10 Hz system cycle rate.

**Consequences:** All partitions must complete their critical operations within assigned windows. Window overruns trigger health monitoring alerts.

**Approvers:** System Lead (J.Smith), Safety Lead (M.Johnson)
