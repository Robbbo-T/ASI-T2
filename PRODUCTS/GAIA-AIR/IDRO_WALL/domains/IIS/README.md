## Purpose & Scope

**IIS** (Integrated Intelligence & Software) owns:

* **Swarm Intelligence**: Collective decision-making algorithms for coordinated drone behavior
* **MAL-EEM Integration**: Ethics and empathy module for fail-closed ethical compliance
* **Autonomous Behaviors**: Self-organizing formations, obstacle avoidance, mission execution
* **Decision Engine**: Real-time planning and replanning based on mission objectives and constraints
* **Federation Entanglement (FE)**: Coordination framework for unit elements (UEs)
* **Mission Planning**: Integration with QAIM-2 for quantum-optimized path planning

**IIS excludes** (owned by other domains):
* Physical communication protocols → LCC
* Sensor hardware and data acquisition → EDI
* Propulsion control → CQH
* Power management → EEE
