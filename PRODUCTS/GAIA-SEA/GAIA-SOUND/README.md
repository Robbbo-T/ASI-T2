# GAIA-SOUND — Sea Organisms and Universal Nature Diagnostics

**Product Line**: GAIA-SEA  
**Field**: Environmental, Emissions & Remediation (EER)  
**Environment**: SEA, DEEP_SEA  
**Primary Domains**: EER, IIS, EDI, LCC, LIB

## Overview

GAIA-SOUND is a bioacoustic oceanic platform for sea organisms diagnostics and universal nature health monitoring. The system combines advanced hydrophone sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), AI-powered signal processing, and quantum optimization to provide comprehensive marine habitat assessment and environmental compliance monitoring.

## Key Capabilities

- **Bioacoustic Monitoring**: Real-time detection and classification of marine species through acoustic signatures
- **Environmental Diagnostics**: Comprehensive ocean health scoring and habitat assessment
- **Quantum-Enhanced Processing**: QAIM-2 integrated optimization for sensor placement and signal processing
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Hydrophones, AUVs, gliders, and surface buoys
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Environmental regulatory compliance and reporting
