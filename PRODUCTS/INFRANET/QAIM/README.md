# QAIM — Quantum Aerospace Intelligence Model

The core product of the ASI-T2 portfolio: the **Quantum AI Model for Quantum Augmented/Accelerated Industrial Management (QAIM)** itself. This product is not a physical asset but the foundational, cross-cutting operating system for industrial optimization that powers all other ASI-T2 products.

It provides **QOx (Quantum-Optimized X)** as a service, enabling the solution of intractable problems in design, logistics, and ethics.

## Overview

Target: A hardware-agnostic, self-optimizing software platform that provides the core quantum and classical algorithms for the entire ASI-T2 portfolio. QAIM is a "system of systems" for intelligence, optimized for **solution quality ↑**, **time-to-solution ↓**, **energy-per-solution ↓**, and **auditable ethical compliance ↑**.

As a meta-product, QAIM's engineering follows the same rigorous processes it enforces on others. Its development is a unique case of **recursive self-improvement**, where QAIM is used to optimize its own components.

**Scope anchors**

*   **Field:** Quantum Aerospace (the science and engineering of quantum systems for aerospace).
*   **Environment:** Intelligence Model (an abstract, computational environment).
*   **Lifecycle:** Domains decomposed into CAx processes (designing QAIM) and QOx processes (using QAIM to optimize itself).
*   **Documentation:** ATA-aligned folders adapted for a complex software and intelligence architecture.

## QAIM-2: Recursive Self-Optimization Matrix

QAIM applies its own optimization capabilities to improve its performance, efficiency, and robustness. This is a unique, recursive application of the QAIM-2 methodology.

## Workflows

The development of QAIM follows a **self-referential improvement loop**:

1.  **Model (CAx)** → A component of the QAIM platform (e.g., its problem compiler, its hybrid scheduler) is modeled as a classical software system in `domains/IIS/cax/CASE/`.
2.  **Identify Bottleneck** → Performance analysis reveals a computational bottleneck (e.g., finding the best way to decompose a large problem).
3.  **Encode (QOx)** → This bottleneck is formulated as a QUBO problem—*by QAIM itself*—and stored in `domains/IIS/qox/CAI/problems/`.
4.  **Solve** → QAIM's current solver version is used to solve the optimization problem for its *next* version. Results are sealed in `.../runs/`.
5.  **Integrate & Deploy** → The optimized component is integrated back into the QAIM codebase, creating a more powerful version of the platform.
6.  **Document (ATA)** → The architecture improvement is formally documented in `domains/DDD/ata/ATA-45/`.

---

## Evidence & Compliance

*   **UTCS/QS:** As the source of all evidence seals, the QAIM platform's own development is subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Every code commit, model update, and configuration change is sealed.
*   **Ethics (MAL-EEM):** The MAL-EEM is a core component *of* QAIM, but it also acts as a governor *on* QAIM's development. It is a hard-coded constraint that prevents the development of capabilities that could be used to circumvent ethical rules, ensuring the tool itself remains aligned with ASI-T2 principles.
*   **Bootstrapping Trust:** The integrity of the entire ASI-T2 portfolio depends on the auditable integrity of QAIM. The UTCS log for QAIM is the root of trust for all other products.

---

## Glossary & Acronyms

*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** A software layer that provides a consistent interface to different types of hardware. The **Q-HAL** does this for quantum processors.
*   **Ontology:** A formal, machine-readable specification of a set of concepts and the relationships between them. The "Ethical Ontology" is a prime example.
*   **Problem Encoding Layer (PEL):** The component of QAIM that automatically converts high-level problem descriptions into mathematical QUBO/BQM form.
*   **Recursive Self-Optimization:** The process by which a system uses its own capabilities to improve its own components.
*   **Solver Kernel:** The core algorithmic engine within QAIM that executes the quantum or hybrid computation.

## QAIM — FAQ

**Q1. What is QAIM in the simplest terms?**
Think of it as the "brain" or "operating system" for the entire ASI-T2 portfolio. It's a software platform that gives products like BWB-Q100 and GAIA-SAT the superpower of quantum optimization. They send it their hardest problems, and QAIM finds the best solution.

**Q2. How can a software platform be a "product"?**
It's our core intellectual property. It is versioned, licensed, and deployed to other ASI-T2 projects. An update to QAIM (e.g., `v2.1`) can instantly improve the performance of every other product in the portfolio without them changing their own code.

**Q3. The matrix mentions "Recursive Self-Optimization." What does that mean?**
It means we use QAIM to improve QAIM. For example, if we want to make our quantum compiler better at mapping problems to qubits, we can frame "find the best mapping" as an optimization problem. We then feed that problem into the *current* version of QAIM. The solution it gives us becomes part of the *next* version of the compiler, making it more powerful. It's a continuous improvement loop.

**Q4. Who are the "users" of the QAIM product?**
The primary users are the engineering and AI agents working on the other products (BWB-Q100, LH2-CORRIDOR, etc.). They interact with QAIM through a standardized API, submitting problems and receiving solutions without needing to be experts in quantum physics.

**Q5. What is the role of the `CQH` domain here? There's no liquid hydrogen.**
In the context of the QAIM product, `CQH`'s "Quantum" responsibility is paramount. This domain team builds and maintains the **Quantum Hardware Abstraction Layer (Q-HAL)**. They are responsible for making sure QAIM can talk to any quantum computer—whether from D-Wave, IBM, Quantinuum, or future providers—through a single, stable interface. This makes our platform future-proof.

**Q6. How is the integrity of QAIM itself guaranteed?**
Through the **`DDD` (Digital & Data Defense)** domain. This team ensures that every line of code, every algorithm, and every update to QAIM is cryptographically signed and logged in the UTCS. Any unauthorized change would be instantly detected, making the platform's history completely auditable and trustworthy.
