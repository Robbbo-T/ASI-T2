# Platform Abstraction Layer

Hardware abstraction and Board Support Packages (BSP) for different aerospace platforms.

## Supported Platforms

- **UAV**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle platforms with real-time requirements
- **Satellite**: Space-qualified systems with radiation hardening
- **Ground**: Ground stations and mission control centers

## Architecture

Each platform provides:
- Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
- Board support package (BSP)
- Device drivers and firmware
- ARINC-653 partition configurations
- Safety and security configurations

## Platform Requirements

### Common Requirements
- DO-178C compliance for software
- DO-254 compliance for hardware
- ARINC-653 partitioning support
- Deterministic timing guarantees
- Secure boot and attestation

### Platform-Specific
- **UAV**: Size, Weight, Power (SWaP) constraints
- **Satellite**: Radiation tolerance and space qualification
- **Ground**: High availability and redundancy

## Development Process

1. **Hardware Specification**: Define platform requirements and constraints
2. **BSP Development**: Create board support package and drivers
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate hardware/software integration
4. **Certification**: Safety and security certification process
5. **Deployment**: Production deployment and maintenance
