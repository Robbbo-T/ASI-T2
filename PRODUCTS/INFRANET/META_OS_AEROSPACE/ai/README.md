# AI/ML Layer - Meta-OS Aerospace

This directory contains AI/ML components for the Meta-OS aerospace system, providing intelligent capabilities for autonomous operations, predictive maintenance, and mission optimization.

## Architecture

The AI layer is structured for safety-critical aerospace applications:

- **Edge Runtime**: Deterministic AI inference engines for real-time operations
- **Models**: Certified AI models for vision, planning, and health monitoring

## Safety Considerations

All AI components operate under strict safety constraints:

- **Out-of-loop advisory**: AI provides recommendations, not direct control
- **Deterministic execution**: Bounded inference times for real-time systems
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Traditional algorithms available when AI fails
- **Certification compliance**: Models validated for DO-178C/DO-326A requirements

## Integration Points

- **FDIR System**: AI-enhanced fault prediction and diagnosis
- **Digital Twin**: Machine learning for state estimation and prediction
- **Mission Planning**: Autonomous route optimization and replanning
- **Sensor Fusion**: Computer vision for navigation and obstacle avoidance

## Development Guidelines

1. **Determinism First**: All AI operations must have bounded execution times
2. **Safety Validation**: Models require extensive testing and verification
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation without AI
4. **Explainable AI**: Decisions must be traceable and auditable

## Subdirectories

- `edge-runtime/`: Real-time AI inference engines and runtime systems
- `models/`: Trained and certified AI models for various aerospace tasks
