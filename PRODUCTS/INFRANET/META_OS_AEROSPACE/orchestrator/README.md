# System Orchestrator

Federated orchestration engine for coordinating heterogeneous aerospace assets with mission-aware scheduling and resource management.

## Architecture Overview

The orchestrator operates as a distributed system with the following components:

### Control Plane
- **Scheduler**: Assigns tasks to assets based on capabilities and constraints
- **Placement Engine**: Determines optimal asset deployment locations
- **Reconciler**: Ensures desired state matches actual system state
- **Admission Controller**: Validates and authorizes new missions and assets

### Edge Agents
- **Asset Agents**: Run on each asset (UAV, satellite, ground station)
- **Telemetry Collection**: Gather health and performance metrics
- **Command Execution**: Execute orchestrator commands locally
- **Status Reporting**: Report asset state back to control plane

## Key Features

### Mission-Aware Orchestration
Unlike generic container orchestrators (Kubernetes), the Meta-OS orchestrator understands:
- **Physical Constraints**: Power, weight, thermal limits
- **Temporal Requirements**: Real-time deadlines, scheduling windows
- **Safety Requirements**: Fault tolerance, emergency procedures
- **Environmental Factors**: Weather, terrain, electromagnetic interference

### Heterogeneous Asset Management
- **Multi-Platform Support**: UAV, satellite, ground station coordination
- **Protocol Translation**: Bridge between different communication standards
- **Capability Matching**: Match mission requirements to asset capabilities
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload across available assets

### Real-Time Scheduling
- **Deterministic Scheduling**: Guaranteed response times for critical operations
- **Priority-Based Preemption**: Higher priority missions can override lower priority ones
- **Resource Reservation**: Reserve computing, power, and communication resources
- **Deadline Awareness**: Schedule tasks to meet mission-critical deadlines

## Mission Lifecycle

### 1. Mission Planning
```yaml
# Example mission manifest
missionId: RESCUE-2024-001
priority: CRITICAL
assets:
  - type: search_uav
    count: 3
    requirements:
      thermal_camera: true
      flight_time_min: 120
  - type: relay_satellite
    count: 1
    orbit: LEO
```

### 2. Asset Discovery and Selection
- Query available assets and their capabilities
- Match assets to mission requirements
- Consider geographic constraints and communication windows
- Reserve selected assets for mission duration

### 3. Mission Deployment
- Generate detailed task assignments for each asset
- Configure communication channels and data flows
- Deploy software and configuration updates if needed
- Initiate coordinated mission execution

### 4. Runtime Management
- Monitor asset health and mission progress
- Adapt to changing conditions (weather, failures)
- Rebalance workload as needed
- Handle emergency situations and contingencies

### 5. Mission Completion
- Collect final results and telemetry data
- Release reserved assets for other missions
- Generate mission report and lessons learned
- Update asset maintenance schedules

## Fault Tolerance

### Asset Failures
- **Redundancy**: Multiple assets for critical functions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue mission with reduced capability
- **Automatic Failover**: Reassign tasks to healthy assets
- **Recovery Procedures**: Attempt to restore failed assets

### Communication Failures
- **Store-and-Forward**: Cache data during communication outages
- **Alternative Paths**: Use backup communication channels
- **Delay-Tolerant Networking**: Handle intermittent connectivity
- **Priority Queuing**: Ensure critical messages get through first

### Control Plane Failures
- **Leader Election**: Automatically select new control plane leader
- **State Replication**: Distribute orchestrator state across multiple nodes
- **Partition Tolerance**: Continue operation during network splits
- **Recovery**: Rebuild state from asset reports after failures

## Integration Points

### AQUA OS Components
- **A653_PM**: Utilize partition manager for real-time scheduling
- **NET_STACK**: Leverage deterministic networking for reliable communication
- **TIME_SYNC**: Coordinate timing across distributed assets
- **SEC_KMS**: Integrate with security framework for authentication

### External Systems
- **Mission Planning Tools**: Import missions from external planning systems
- **Weather Services**: Integrate weather data for mission adaptation
- **Air Traffic Control**: Coordinate with ATC for airspace management
- **Ground Control**: Interface with traditional ground control stations
