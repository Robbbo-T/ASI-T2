# AQUA OS (Aircraft Extension) — TIME_SYNC Component Specification

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ID** | `ASIT2-AQUAOS-AIR-TIMESYNC-COMP` |
| **Revision** | `1.0` |
| **Component** | TIME_SYNC Time & Synchronization (AQUA OS — Aircraft Extension) |
| **Classification** | INTERNAL–EVIDENCE-REQUIRED |
| **Level** | DO-178C DAL-A Platform; PTP/TTE |
| **Owners** | **EDI** (Avionics), **OOO** (OS) |
| **Bridge** | `CB→QB→UE→FE→FWD→QS` |

## 1. Overview

The **TIME_SYNC (Time & Synchronization Service)** provides a unified, monotonic timebase for all AQUA OS Aircraft Extension components using PTP (Precision Time Protocol) and TTE (Time-Triggered Ethernet) with Grandmaster switchover tolerance.

## 2. Architectural Placement within AQUA OS

The TIME_SYNC operates as a fundamental platform service:

* **AQUA Kernel / Hypervisor (Core OS Services)**
    * A653_PM Partition Manager
    * NET_STACK Deterministic Network
    * **TIME_SYNC Time & Sync Service (this component, DAL-A platform)**
    * Security & Secrets Management
    * Health Monitoring & Logging
* **Time Distribution**
    * Hardware timer synchronization
    * Software clock distribution to partitions
    * Network time protocol coordination

## 3. Component Service Contract

### 3.1 Services Provided by TIME_SYNC

| Service | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monotonic Timebase** | System-wide monotonic clock with nanosecond resolution |
| **GM Switchover** | Seamless Grandmaster switchover with ≤300μs disruption |
| **Time Distribution** | Zero-allocation time queries for ARINC-653 partitions |
| **Synchronization Status** | Time quality, drift, and synchronization health monitoring |
| **Network Time Services** | PTP/TTE protocol implementation and coordination |

### 3.2 Services Required from AQUA OS

| Service | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hardware Timers** | High-resolution timer hardware with interrupt capability |
| **Network Access** | Integration with NET_STACK for PTP/TTE protocol messaging |
| **Health Monitoring** | Fault reporting for time synchronization failures |

## 4. Partitioning and Scheduling Contract (PSSC)

TIME_SYNC operates as a platform service with real-time time distribution requirements.

## 5. Interfaces (ICD Summary)

TIME_SYNC provides both platform APIs for time queries and network topics for time status distribution.

## 6. Functional Requirements (MoSCoW)

* **MUST**
    * Provide monotonic timebase with nanosecond resolution
    * Support PTP and TTE time synchronization protocols  
    * Handle Grandmaster switchover within ≤300μs
    * Maintain time drift ≤50 ppm under normal conditions
    * Support jitter budget ≤500μs for subscribed topics
    * Provide zero-allocation time queries via get_time_ns() API
    * Monitor and report time synchronization health
* **SHOULD**
    * Optimize for minimal CPU overhead in time distribution
    * Support multiple time sources with priority ordering
* **COULD**
    * Implement adaptive clock adjustment algorithms
* **WON'T (baseline)**
    * Depend on quantum time sources (out-of-loop only)
    * Support leap second handling during flight

## 7. Verification and Conformance Strategy

* **Unit Testing**: Time calculation accuracy, API performance, switchover logic
* **Integration Testing**: Network protocol integration, multi-component timing
* **Certification Testing**: DO-178C DAL-A evidence, timing determinism proofs

## 8. Cross-Product Binding (BWB-Q100 Example)

When deployed on BWB-Q100, TIME_SYNC provides the timebase for QAFbW control loops, navigation updates, and all timestamped data throughout the avionics system.
