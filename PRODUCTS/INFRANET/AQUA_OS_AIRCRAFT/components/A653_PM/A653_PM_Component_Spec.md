# AQUA OS (Aircraft Extension) — A653_PM Component Specification

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ID** | `ASIT2-AQUAOS-AIR-A653PM-COMP` |
| **Revision** | `1.0` |
| **Component** | A653_PM Partition Manager (AQUA OS — Aircraft Extension) |
| **Classification** | INTERNAL–EVIDENCE-REQUIRED |
| **Level** | DO-178C DAL-A Platform; DO-297 IMA; ARINC-653 |
| **Owners** | **OOO** (OS), **IIS** (Integration) |
| **Bridge** | `CB→QB→UE→FE→FWD→QS` |

## 1. Overview

The **A653_PM (ARINC-653 Partition Manager)** is the foundational hypervisor component of AQUA OS Aircraft Extension that provides spatial and temporal partitioning services compliant with ARINC-653 standards. It ensures freedom from interference between partitions of different criticality levels.

## 2. Architectural Placement within AQUA OS

The A653_PM operates as the core hypervisor layer beneath all application partitions:

* **AQUA Hypervisor Core**
    * **A653_PM Partition Manager (this component, DAL-A platform)**
    * Memory Management Unit (MMU) abstraction
    * Time partition scheduling
    * Inter-partition communication control
* **Application Partitions (managed by A653_PM)**
    * P1: QAFbW Control Stack (DAL-A)
    * P2: Navigation & Air Data Systems (DAL-B)
    * P3: HMI & Maintenance Systems (DAL-B/C)
    * P4: Quantum Assist Services (DAL-C)

## 3. Component Service Contract

### 3.1 Services Provided by A653_PM

| Service | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spatial Partitioning** | Memory protection, MMU management, partition isolation |
| **Temporal Partitioning** | Time slicing, major frame scheduling, partition windows |
| **Inter-Partition Comm** | Controlled message passing, shared memory regions |
| **Resource Management** | CPU budget enforcement, memory allocation tracking |
| **Health Monitoring** | Partition overrun detection, deadline miss reporting |

### 3.2 Services Required from Hardware

| Service | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **MMU Hardware** | Memory management unit with protection domains |
| **Timer Hardware** | High-precision timer for partition scheduling |
| **Interrupt Controller** | Hardware interrupt isolation and routing |

## 4. Partitioning and Scheduling Contract (PSSC)

A653_PM operates as the foundational scheduler with its own resource allocation.

## 5. Interfaces (ICD Summary)

A653_PM provides platform APIs rather than network topics.

## 6. Functional Requirements (MoSCoW)

* **MUST**
    * Enforce ARINC-653 spatial and temporal partitioning
    * Provide freedom from interference between DAL levels
    * Support major frame lengths of 10-100ms
    * Detect and report partition overruns within 1ms
    * Maintain partition isolation under all fault conditions
    * Support at least 8 application partitions simultaneously
* **SHOULD**
    * Optimize context switch times to <50μs
    * Provide deterministic partition startup sequences
* **COULD**
    * Support dynamic partition reconfiguration (ground-only)
* **WON'T (baseline)**
    * Support nested virtualization
    * Implement partition migration between cores

## 7. Verification and Conformance Strategy

* **Unit Testing**: Platform API correctness, isolation verification
* **Integration Testing**: Multi-partition scenarios, overrun handling
* **Certification Testing**: DO-178C DAL-A evidence generation

## 8. Cross-Product Binding (BWB-Q100 Example)

When deployed on BWB-Q100, A653_PM manages QAFbW flight control partition alongside navigation, HMI, and maintenance partitions with strict isolation guarantees.
