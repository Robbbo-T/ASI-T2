# IETP_BRIDGE S1000D Integration Component

Interactive Electronic Technical Publication (S1000D) Bridge for maintenance documentation integration.

## Component Overview

**Purpose**: Interactive Electronic Technical Publication (S1000D) Bridge for maintenance documentation integration.

**Certification Level**: DO-178C DAL-B (Design Assurance Level B)

**Architecture**: ARINC-653 partitioned application running on AQUA OS kernel services

## Document Structure

### Core Specifications
- **[Component Specification](./IETP_BRIDGE_Component_Spec.md)**: Complete technical specification
- **[System Requirements (SRD)](./IETP_BRIDGE_SRD.md)**: MoSCoW requirements matrix
- **[Interface Control Document (ICD)](./IETP_BRIDGE_ICD.yaml)**: Message formats and protocols (if available)
- **[Partition & Schedule Spec (PSSC)](./IETP_BRIDGE_PSSC.json)**: Resource allocation and scheduling (if available)

### Verification & Validation

## Verification Strategy

### Test Requirements
- Requirements traceability through VCRM matrix
- Unit testing with appropriate coverage for DAL-B certification
- Integration testing with AQUA OS platform services
- System-level validation in target aircraft environment

### Evidence Requirements
- All test artifacts sealed via UTCS/QS evidence service
- Configuration management through formal change control
- Compliance verification for DO-178C DAL-B requirements

## Development Status

**Current Status**: SPECIFICATION COMPLETE

**Next Steps**:
1. Stakeholder review and baseline approval
2. Detailed design and implementation  
3. Unit testing and component verification
4. Integration testing with AQUA OS platform
5. System-level validation and certification evidence
