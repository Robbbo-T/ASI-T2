# UTCS_QS System Requirements (MoSCoW)

## MUST

- UTCSQS-SRD-001 Anchoring: Produce anchor within 50ms; never block control partitions.
- UTCSQS-SRD-002 Integrity: Generate tamper-evident SHA-256 hashes for all evidence items.
- UTCSQS-SRD-003 Reproducibility: Support reproducible build verification and configuration tracking.
- UTCSQS-SRD-004 API: Provide non-blocking evidence sealing API for all system components.
- UTCSQS-SRD-005 Storage: Maintain secure evidence storage with retrieval capabilities.
- UTCSQS-SRD-006 Audit Trail: Record all evidence operations with timestamps and component IDs.

## SHOULD

- UTCSQS-SRD-007 Performance: Minimize storage overhead and optimize retrieval times.

## WON'T (baseline)

- UTCSQS-SRD-008 No external blockchain dependency.
- UTCSQS-SRD-009 No real-time evidence streaming.

## Resource Baseline

- CPU: ≤2% of a core for evidence operations
- Memory: ≤8 MiB for evidence cache and operations
- Storage: Secure non-volatile storage for evidence archives
