# UTCS_QS Evidence & Trace Service Component

Evidence & Trace Service providing immutable evidence anchoring for builds, configurations, test runs, and audit trail maintenance.

## Component Overview

**Purpose**: Evidence & Trace Service providing immutable evidence anchoring for builds, configurations, test runs, and audit trail maintenance.

**Certification Level**: DO-178C DAL-B (Design Assurance Level B)

**Architecture**: ARINC-653 partitioned application running on AQUA OS kernel services

## Document Structure

### Core Specifications
- **[Component Specification](./UTCS_QS_Component_Spec.md)**: Complete technical specification
- **[System Requirements (SRD)](./UTCS_QS_SRD.md)**: MoSCoW requirements matrix
- **[Interface Control Document (ICD)](./UTCS_QS_ICD.yaml)**: Message formats and protocols (if available)
- **[Partition & Schedule Spec (PSSC)](./UTCS_QS_PSSC.json)**: Resource allocation and scheduling (if available)

### Verification & Validation
- **[Verification Matrix (VCRM)](./UTCS_QS_VCRM.csv)**: Requirements traceability matrix (if available)
- **[Test Plan](./UTCS_QS_Test_Plan.md)**: Comprehensive test strategy and procedures

## Integration Points

### AQUA OS Platform Integration
The UTCS_QS component integrates with the AQUA OS platform through:
- **OOO Domain**: Operating system services and partition management
- **IIS Domain**: Software integration and verification framework
- **EDI Domain**: Avionics and network integration (where applicable)

### Cross-Component Dependencies
- Integration with other AQUA OS components through standardized ARINC-653 interfaces
- Participation in platform-wide health monitoring and fault management
- Compliance with AQUA OS timing and resource allocation policies

## Verification Strategy

### Test Requirements
- Requirements traceability through VCRM matrix
- Unit testing with appropriate coverage for DAL-B certification
- Integration testing with AQUA OS platform services
- System-level validation in target aircraft environment

### Evidence Requirements
- All test artifacts sealed via UTCS/QS evidence service
- Configuration management through formal change control
- Compliance verification for DO-178C DAL-B requirements

## Development Status

**Current Status**: SPECIFICATION COMPLETE

**Next Steps**:
1. Stakeholder review and baseline approval
2. Detailed design and implementation  
3. Unit testing and component verification
4. Integration testing with AQUA OS platform
5. System-level validation and certification evidence
