## 1. Overview

The **SEC_KMS (Security & Key Management System)** provides cryptographic services, secure boot verification, and key management for AQUA OS Aircraft Extension, ensuring secure operation and message authentication across the platform.

## 2. Architectural Placement within AQUA OS

SEC_KMS operates as a security-critical platform service:

* **AQUA Kernel / Hypervisor (Core OS Services)**
    * A653_PM Partition Manager
    * NET_STACK Deterministic Network
    * TIME_SYNC Service
    * **SEC_KMS Security & Key Management (this component, DAL-A)**
    * Health Monitoring & Logging

## 3. Component Service Contract
