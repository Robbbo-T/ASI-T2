# LOG_TEL Logging & Telemetry Component

Logging & Telemetry service for system event recording and data transmission.

## Component Overview

**Purpose**: Logging & Telemetry service for system event recording and data transmission.

**Certification Level**: DO-178C DAL-A (Design Assurance Level A)

**Architecture**: ARINC-653 partitioned application running on AQUA OS kernel services

## Document Structure

### Core Specifications
- **[Component Specification](./LOG_TEL_Component_Spec.md)**: Complete technical specification
- **[System Requirements (SRD)](./LOG_TEL_SRD.md)**: MoSCoW requirements matrix
- **[Interface Control Document (ICD)](./LOG_TEL_ICD.yaml)**: Message formats and protocols (if available)
- **[Partition & Schedule Spec (PSSC)](./LOG_TEL_PSSC.json)**: Resource allocation and scheduling (if available)

### Verification & Validation
- **[Verification Matrix (VCRM)](./LOG_TEL_VCRM.csv)**: Requirements traceability matrix (if available)
