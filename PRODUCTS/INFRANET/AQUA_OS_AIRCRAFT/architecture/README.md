# AQUA OS Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the AQUA (AVIONICS / ASTRIONICS QUANTUM UPDATING ARCHITECTURE) system.

## Contents

### Core Architecture

- **[AQUA.md](./AQUA.md)** - Complete AQUA architecture specification
  - TFA V2 Bridge Integration (CB→QB→UE→FE→FWD→QS)
  - Continuous Quantum Updating (CQU)
  - Cross-Domain Synchronization
  - MAL (Master Application Layer/Logic) Integration
  - Federation Entanglement (FE) Compliance
  - Forwarding (FWD) Capabilities
  - AQUA Block Diagrams and Integration Flows

## Overview

AQUA is the Quantum Updating Architecture layer of the TFA (Thread-First Architecture) stack dedicated to avionics and astrionics systems. It provides:

- **Real-time update, validation, and entanglement** across flight systems
- **Seamless integration** between avionics and astrionics domains
- **Ethical compliance** through MAL-EEM framework
- **Complete traceability** via UTCS/QS evidence sealing
- **Multi-stakeholder coordination** for aerospace operations

- [INFRANET Portfolio](../../README.md)
- [ASI-T2 Repository Root](../../../../README.md)

## Architecture Principles

1. **Safety First**: Out-of-loop quantum services, deterministic behavior, fail-safe defaults
2. **Certification-Ready**: DO-178C, DO-297, ECSS compliance built-in
3. **Evidence-Based**: Complete audit trails through QS sealing
4. **Ethics-Aware**: MAL-EEM integration for ethical decision-making
5. **Interoperable**: Standards-based interfaces for multi-vendor integration
